            <p>From the vantage point of our present twenty-first century moment, it would seem impossible
               to miss the centrality of issues of slavery and freedom, of racial oppression and
               Black resistance, to British economic, political, and cultural life during the five
               decades from the 1780s through the 1830s. Yet until (comparatively) quite recently,
               academic and critical discourses on British Romantic literature left these issues
               all but entirely out of account. In retrospect, one can diagnose a conservative and
               indeed White supremacist impulse behind the construction of the academic study of
               literary Romanticism and its dominant canon. The essays in this volume do not simply
               help fill in this enormous critical blind spot (building on the past thirty years
               of remedial work by a growing number of scholars) but offer to fundamentally reorient
               the way Romanticists envision, organize, and (most importantly) teach their field.
               Most strikingly, they collectively challenge longstanding notions of what makes this
               period “Romantic” through a strategic and innovative disordering of chronology, leading
               to creative and revealing juxtapositions between then and now, with reference as well
               to various charged historical moments in between. In doing so, they help us see as
               well a vast web of interconnections among some of the most pressing issues of our
               own time and the literary and cultural artifacts they bring into the classroom, and
               into the canon.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Beyond the Romantic Chronology</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Reading through this collection of original essays, I have found myself struck again
               and again at the ingenious and telling ways contributors have chosen to deploy, disorder,
               and invert chronology. The inversions begin with the trenchant introduction by the
               editors, Joselyn M. Almeida and Amelia Worsley, who move strategically backward from
               the racist assaults on Black lives in the present-day United States, through a series
               of twentieth- and twenty-first-century interventions in Romantic scholarship, before
               leaping back to the British Romantic era itself. I will take a somewhat different
               tack (or rather, series of tacks) through the timeline, beginning almost thirty-five
               years ago before moving to consider the six essays that follow Almeida and Worsley’s
               lead. </p>
            <p>In 1990, then, I put out a call for papers for a special MLA session on “Africa in
               the Romantic Imagination”—so far as I knew, or yet know, the first session of its
               kind. The call mentioned not only representations of sub-Saharan Africa, but also
               of race, of slavery in the Americas, of antislavery writing, of the African diaspora
               in England. I cast the net widely. To small avail. Although I issued the call at the
               earliest possible time, over the months of waiting I received a single unsolicited
               proposal. Working my network of friends and colleagues in the profession, I managed
               to drum up one other and then added a proposal of my own, an early version of the
               article that introduced the topic of obeah to Romantic studies (Richardson, “Romantic
               Voodoo”). The session was accepted by the MLA convention committee. It drew a small
               but, as I choose to remember it, an appreciative audience.</p>
            <p>No one could read through the introduction to the present collection, let alone the
               essays that follow, without understanding the Romantic era—let’s call it 1780–1838—as
               the chronological period that saw the height of the British slave trade, a growing
               British colonial empire fueled by slavery, a burgeoning Black population in Britain
               itself, mass movements advocating abolition and emancipation (the first mass political
               movements in British history), an outpouring of antislavery writings of many kinds,
               and a series of slave uprisings and rebellions in the British “sugar islands.” And
               so it was. And yet, in 1990, all this had long remained virtually invisible to mainstream
               Romantic scholarship to date: hardly unthinkable, but rarely thought of. That same
               year, I published an essay on William Blake’s “The Little Black Boy” in relation to
               issues of race and colonial slavery (Richardson, “Colonialism”). Researching that
               piece I found, much to my amazement, that no one had ever thought to publish such
               an essay before, and that Blake scholars had not bothered to ask what Blake meant
               by the “southern wild” or what had brought this imagined Black boy into contact with
               his “little English” counterpart. How, I wondered, was this astounding lack of interest—not
               to say intellectual responsibility—even possible?</p>
            <p>Folding this particular, and particularly glaring, absence into a larger evasion of
               history and politics characteristic of Romanticism as it was long taught and studied
               will not do. As David Perkins demonstrated in detail some time ago, what came to be
               called the “Romantic Movement” had been tightly linked with the energies of the French
               Revolution as early as 1802 (by Francis Jeffrey), a linkage that had become a “critical
               commonplace” by the Victorian era (88–90, 99–103). Between William Wordsworth’s “levelling
               muse,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s notorious radical-to-conservative arc, Lord Byron’s
               consistent (his only consistent) ideal of “liberty,” and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s outspoken
               radicalism, Romantic scholarship never forgot the impact of European revolutionary
               politics for long. But the slave trade, colonial slavery, the antislavery movement
               and its vast literature, the contributions of Black writers: this history long remained
               invisible.</p>
            <p>Not because the relevant information and trustworthy pointers to the archival record
               would have been hard to find. One needed only turn to Eva Beatrice Dykes’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Negro in Romantic Thought</span> (1942) and Wylie Sypher’s <span style="font-style:italic">Guinea’s Captive Kings</span> (1942)—yet for half a century practically no one did. David V. Erdman’s <span style="font-style:italic">Blake: Prophet against Empire</span> (1954), the most prominent book to challenge the field’s aversion to issues of race,
               slavery, and colonialism, did not penetrate very far out of the tight circle of Blake
               scholarship and, even there, remained eclipsed by the mythopoeic approaches of Northrop
               Frye and Harold Bloom until rediscovered during the new historicist turn of the 1980s
               and 1990s. And, even then, Romantic scholarship lagged behind its neighboring fields:
               eighteenth-century scholars like Moira Ferguson and Victorianists like Patrick Brantliger
               were publishing important studies on antislavery writing, British exploitation of
               Africa, and the rise of modern racism by the mid-1980s, at a time when Henry Louis
               Gates Jr. began drawing critical attention to (as well as republishing) early Black
               British writers like Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince (both included in Gates’s 1987
               volume, <span style="font-style:italic">The Classic Slave Narratives</span>).</p>
            <p>How else, then, to account for the history of erasure that I and, as it turned out,
               a few scattered Romanticist colleagues found ourselves confronting in 1990? Diagnosing
               a different set of erasures—of the sensibility and sentimental modes so crucial to
               the emergence of anything meaningfully called “Romanticism” and, in particular, of
               the female poets who helped develop them—Jerome McGann noted how a history of “reading
               romanticism through its most conservative venues” had effectively repressed critical
               attention to the “poetics of sensibility” (2). So effectively, indeed, that Romanticists
               had not only failed to read these poets and poetic modes but had lost the ability
               to meaningfully read them at all. From the perspective of 2024, we can add that influential
               constructions of Romanticism, from the Victorian era through nearly the end of the
               twentieth century, were not only masculinist in tendency but racist and white supremacist
               as well. Whatever the Romantic archive held, whatever the various (and often changing)
               views espoused by the literally thousands of writers active during that fraught half
               century, one retrospective version of the field after another, in anthologies, in
               literary histories, in critical studies, in class syllabi, rendered the Black lives
               of the era invisible, including the millions of Black lives sacrificed to kidnapping,
               the Middle Passage, colonial slavery, and early death. None of this mattered.</p>
            <p>An essay that came out in 1989 both diagnosed and illustrated the problem. In a critical
               examination of Wordsworth’s apathetic response to the movement against the “traffickers
               in Negro blood” (1805 <span style="font-style:italic">Prelude</span> 10.206), Mary Jacobus located a “historical repression” of the slave trade endemic
               to “high Romantic discourse” (69, 90). But Jacobus failed sufficiently to note that
               “high” Romanticism was and always had been a retrospective construct, the culling
               of a few hundred “essential” texts from a vast archive, a selection, as we have noted,
               motivated in part both by masculinist and racist agendas. Hence “high” Romanticism
               could by definition never include the era’s significant outpouring of antislavery
               literature, a great deal of it contributed by women writers. This reification of a
               purely contingent canon and construction of the field operated well into the twentieth
               century (when “high” Romanticism had, in retrospect almost bizarrely, become confined
               largely to selected works by six male poets). Perversely enough, the same reification
               even informs the first book-length study of Romanticism and slavery to appear since
               Dykes’s 1942 book, <span style="font-style:italic">Mind-Forg’d Manacles</span> (1994), in which the author, Joan Baum, pointedly differentiates “propaganda” verse
               from the “essential contribution of the Romantics,” whose “<span style="font-style:italic">genius</span>” was to “<span style="font-style:italic">avoid palpable or overt</span>” moral engagement (xi, 69, caption to figure 13). Case closed.</p>
            <p>So the academic field of British Romanticism, in 1990, badly needed reconstruction:
               a project that would take decades of critical work, the latest phase of which this
               volume embodies. Earlier phases—still far from complete—have involved several related
               strategies. One has concerned a combination of archival research and the republishing
               of works long kept out of circulation, as a necessary corrective to both the progressive
               narrowing of the Romantic canon and the field’s longstanding refusal to account for
               Black voices and Black lives. <span style="font-style:italic">Slavery, Abolition, and Emancipation: Writings in the British Romantic Period</span> (1999), the capacious eight-volume set assembled by Peter Kitson and Debbie Lee,
               stands as the major accomplishment along these lines to date. I would note here as
               well the collections of early Black British writing and the anthologies of antislavery
               verse listed by Almeida and Worsley in their introductory survey. Most of these works
               needed not simply to be republished (in print or online) but edited and introduced—made
               usable to scholars and students encountering them for the first time. This effort,
               as I can personally attest, has often involved a good deal of primary research, as
               even some of the most basic questions of authorship, publication history, and early
               reception had remained murky for over a century and a half. Important Romantic-era
               authors like Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, Mary Birkett, and Edward Rushton, for example,
               had become little more than names attached to titles in rare books collections before
               Romantics scholars began undertaking this work of recovery in earnest in the 1990s,
               building on research by pioneers in other fields like Gates, Ferguson, and David Dabydeen.</p>
            <p>A second strategy has involved moving “beyond formalism” in a double sense. As part
               of breaking away from notions of a “high” or “essential” Romanticism virtually untethered
               from its human context, the field needed to recruit new reading methodologies not
               only from the “new” historicism but, in this case, from such fields as colonial discourse
               studies, critical race theory, cultural criticism, and postcolonial studies as well.
               The imaginary (not to mention arbitrary and unstable) line between literature and
               ideology, “poetry” and “propaganda,” needed to be repeatedly challenged. And “beyond
               formalism,” as well, in Geoffrey Hartman’s sense that formalism (as in the American
               New Criticism) had not been “formalistic enough” (542). New reading strategies could
               reveal new tensions, contradictions, and interventions in texts that had been robbed
               of their full ideological force through interpretative methods designed to yield up
               well-wrought, “organic” poetic wholes. In the case of my own work, this doubly post-formalist
               poetics meant, for instance, locating the play of distinct voices in Blake’s “The
               Little Black Boy”—the Afrocentric voice of the mother, the jarring voice of internalized
               oppression, the emergent yet highly fragile ideological consciousness of the child
               speaker himself—and noting the possibilities arising from the contradictions among
               them. Or locating the stylistic and ideological fractures in “The Sorrows of Yamba”—a
               popular text for recent republishing efforts—that ultimately revealed the hand of
               two distinct authors (Richardson, “‘Sorrows of Yamba’”). These two strategies for
               moving past formalism can effectively complement one another in the classroom, as
               several essays in this volume attest.</p>
            <p>From one perspective, such strategies reflected a willingness to bring the ethical
               and political concerns of the present to bear on the histories and literary artifacts
               of the past. And, indeed, some of us were accused at the time of critical “anachronism,”
               of the “condescension of the present,” as though Romantic-era writers like Cugoano
               had never advanced cogent antiracist arguments, as though literally thousands of pamphlets,
               broadsides, and poems had not been written condemning slavery and the slave trade,
               as though even a conservative like Hannah More had not denounced the capture and forced
               transport of millions of Africans on the grounds of “human rights” (<span style="font-style:italic">Slavery, a Poem</span>, line 260). Yet, from a different perspective, such work might be seen as a corrective
               to and thickening of the traditional Romantic chronology. Adding in historical dates
               like 1772 (Mansfield’s <span style="font-style:italic">Somerset</span> decision), 1781 (the <span style="font-style:italic">Zong</span> massacre), 1788 (the first great outpouring of antislavery agitation, petitions,
               and writings), 1791 (the Haitian Revolution), 1795–96 (the second Maroon War in Jamaica),
               1807 (the abolition of the slave trade), 1823 (the Demerara slave revolt), and 1831
               (the “Christmas” rebellion in Jamaica). Adding in literary dates like 1773 (Phillis
               Wheatley Peters’s <span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span>), 1782 (Ignatius Sancho’s <span style="font-style:italic">Letters</span>), 1786 (Thomas Clarkson’s <span style="font-style:italic">Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species</span>), 1787 (Cugoano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Thoughts and Sentiments</span>), 1789 (Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span>), 1817 (Robert Wedderburn’s <span style="font-style:italic">Axe Laid to the Root</span>), and 1831 (Prince’s <span style="font-style:italic">History</span>). Asserting, as the end date to the “Romantic period” construct itself, the claims
               of the Emancipation year 1838, marking the abandonment of the “Apprenticeship” program
               and the effective end of slavery in the British West Indian colonies.</p>
            <p>Yet thirty years of such remedial work—filling in gaps, adding texts and authors,
               reading more historically and more critically—have only done so much. As Almeida and
               Worsley note in their introduction, while we now have a “somewhat” expanded canon,
               antislavery writing still occupies at best a “marginal position” in Romantic pedagogy,
               with just a few (increasingly predictable) additions to course syllabi and too little
               attention to innovative classroom interventions. And so, to return to my initial impression
               of this volume’s own series of interventions, the Romantic chronology needs not just
               filling in but creative disruption, rearrangement, inversion, juxtaposition. Strict
               chronology—despite attempts to render it more faithful—has gone out of date.</p>
            <p>Again, we see the first gesture toward rethinking chronology in the editors’ decision,
               in their introduction, to work backward and “explore how the present moment informs
               the ways that students might currently receive Romantic texts.” This should not be
               viewed as an attempt to make our courses more “relatable” (and perhaps increase our
               market share of bodies in the classroom), although that might prove a kind of side-effect
               of our revisionary efforts. Rather, we would be doing our students an acute disservice,
               and allowing ourselves to appear aridly out of touch, were we to pretend that issues
               of racism, racial violence and oppression, Black agency, and the value of Black lives
               were somehow <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> living and pressing matters. We would also be robbing our students of a chance to
               study the genealogy of our critical situation today in events, practices, and ideologies
               that were salient in the period we study and teach—however long they remained repressed
               from our field’s scholarly consciousness. If this is “presentism,” it is a frank acknowledgment
               of our present concerns and perspectives that better reveals, rather than distorts,
               the long-occluded record of the Romantic past.</p>
            <p>Patricia A. Matthew, in her essay on “Romanticism and the Abolitionist Turn,” aptly
               characterizes the classroom sense of the Romantic era passed on to my own generation
               of scholars: “a period where there are no Black people or people of color, no questions
               about identity, race, and citizenship, and where the only revolutionary activities
               took place in France.” And she argues forcefully that no merely chronological approach
               to the past as somehow disconnected from these questions as posed in our own moment
               will suffice to reorient our, and our students’, attention. As Matthew stresses, primary
               texts do not “teach us about the past” but rather “show us select representations
               of the past”; historians as well can never offer a “fixed report of the past” but
               only a reconstruction inevitably informed by living concerns and debates. By insisting
               throughout her essay on past documents and timelines as <span style="font-style:italic">representations</span>, Matthew offers another way to contest positivist notions of history and implicitly
               white supremacist accounts of the field.</p>
            <p>Nicolas Blaisdell provides first-person evidence of how encountering antislavery writing
               in a college classroom setting can stimulate and inform social justice activism in
               the present, which then in turn feeds into more robust antiracist pedagogical strategies.
               In keeping with this volume’s frequent recourse to chronological inversion, Blaisdell
               begins with an incident from July 2020, an encounter between a group of Black Lives
               Matter activists and officers from the Peabody, Massachusetts police department: a
               beginning that immediately suggests continuities between then and now, and a porousness
               between “academic” pursuits and action in the world. Intriguingly, Blaisdell traces
               his political activism back to his classroom exposure to two early Black British writers,
               Cugoano and Prince, along with the critique of early Victorian laissez-faire capitalism
               developed by Friedrich Engels. Key to Blaisdell’s own critique is his view of slavery
               not simply as a past artifact to study but as a tradition of racialized oppression
               persisting in such twenty-first-century forms as “unfree prison labor, unfree migrant
               labor, and unfree international labor.” Just as significantly, Blaisdell traces the
               emergence of his own antiracist activism to the inspiration of texts and events from
               the Romantic past, when abolitionist groups organized “unprecedented petitions, protests,
               legal proceedings, and other forms of civic action.” His story bears powerful witness
               to the dynamic potential residing in the encounter of the artifactual past, the current
               pursuit of racial and economic justice, and the college classroom.</p>
            <p>In his meditation on “Teaching Antislavery,” Sean Gordon draws on theories of Afropessimism
               to drive home a comparable insistence on the continuities between the Romantic era
               and the moment we find ourselves in today. “I wanted students to engage with this
               continuum,” he writes, “to question their assumptions about the ‘pastness’ of slavery,
               the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism of the Obama
               administration.” To this end, Gordon stretches inherited notions of Romanticism both
               geographically and chronologically. Geographically—by including a late Romantic American
               author like Edgar Allan Poe and by implicitly acknowledging the pointlessness of trying
               to circumscribe so cosmopolitan a writer as Equiano within a British, American, or
               transatlantic tradition: his career in fact exposes the arbitrariness of such categories.
               Chronologically—in bringing out the dialogue between Romantic texts and various later
               texts that demonstrate, in their own ways, the presentness of the past, including
               Mat Johnson’s twenty-first-century response to Poe in <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span>, as well as fiction by Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, and Celu Amberstone. Because
               the Black protagonist of <span style="font-style:italic">Pym</span> begins the novel as an English professor, Gordon’s syllabus also helps break down
               any imagined sense of “college” as a cloistered space somehow insulated from the racist
               ideologies and the incidents of racially motivated violence swirling all around it—and,
               as Gordon’s opening demonstrates, within it. As we attempt to track the major dates
               we transit through in Gordon’s essay—2014, 2015, 2011, 1838, 2004, 1995, 1966, 1789—chronology
               becomes not a series of beads on a string distantly linking then and now but a flexible
               story line, with flashbacks and fast-forwards, foreshadowings and back projections.
               Freed from the remorselessness of chronological succession, Gordon’s students can
               make their own dynamic connections among current, past, and personally experienced
               events and the literary texts that variously represent or refract them.</p>
            <p>Chronological inversions can involve a matter of years or a matter of centuries, as
               Elizabeth Fay’s essay makes clear. Teaching Prince’s <span style="font-style:italic">History</span> (1831) in advance of Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> (1789), while “achronological,” encourages students to encounter Equiano’s more distanced,
               “rhetorically sophisticated” narrative only after registering the powerfully visceral
               impact of Prince’s account. (Fay also exposes her students to first-person historical
               accounts to increase their chances of sensing the “gut-level pain” of colonial slavery.)
               Fay’s pedagogy, like Gordon’s, also extends chronology beyond the present, including
               “Afrofuturist” works like Ryan Coogler’s <span style="font-style:italic">Black Panther</span> film (2018). And, as Ivan Ortiz demonstrates in an especially resonant essay, chronology
               can be pushed backward as well. Asking what it might mean to sing an antislavery ballad
               to the tune of “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Ortiz invites his students, and us, to hear
               the “haunting” of abolitionist verse by prior, colonialist voices, a “white noise”
               that may function to obliterate the otherness of the enslaved subject. His hauntological
               analysis helps us understand the limits of sympathy—now as then—which may forestall
               rather than facilitate an “authentic encounter with human otherness.”</p>
            <p>Expanding on what Fay calls her achronological strategy, Frances Botkin, borrowing
               from Jamaican Creole, develops a critical and pedagogical approach she terms <span style="font-style:italic">tunyuhan</span>. Following the Jamaican Maroon practice of making do (<span style="font-style:italic">mek fashion</span>) with what comes to hand (<span style="font-style:italic">tun yu han</span>, turn your hand), Botkin draws on an eclectic array of materials—“borrowing from
               other fields, experimenting with different genres, and branching into other centuries”—to
               fill in the silences and reveal the distortions endemic even to Black British writing,
               highly mediated as it was, in the Romantic era. Her resources include living Maroon
               oral traditions—and living Maroon speakers and activists. Botkin exposes her students
               to “knowledge beyond the archive” in an effort to incorporate living voices and ultimately
               “remake Romanticism.”</p>
            <p>It might be said that every generation of Romantic scholars and teachers remakes the
               field, but not often, and perhaps not ever, so radically as over the past thirty-five
               to forty-five years of canon revision and critical reorientation. Women writers are
               now, for the first time, well represented in anthologies and teaching syllabi. Black
               writers and antislavery writing remain marginal to the field as a whole, yet the reparative
               work begun in the 1990s continues and the present volume does much to advance it.
               And recent events have shown just how urgent and how vital such work has grown.</p>
            <p>I first read these essays at around the time of the now infamous attack on the U.S.
               Congress as it met to ratify the electoral college results of the 2020 presidential
               election on January 6, 2021. A large mob of right-wing rioters broke into the Capitol
               Building, seeking to disrupt the count, perhaps to murder any number of Democratic
               legislators, and bearing with them Confederate flags, Crusader crosses, nooses, and
               other white nationalist emblems, while sporting an odd combination of tactical apparel
               and Trump campaign gear. It was an attempted coup motivated by racist and white supremacist
               ideologies and egged on by the outgoing (at last) President himself. In the aftermath
               of this brazen attack on American democracy, no one any longer has an excuse for branding
               efforts such as those offered in this volume as “presentism” or as performative “wokeness”
               or as some passing academic leftist fad. All of us are now called to examine the racism
               and white supremacism operative, subtly or not, in our professions and workplaces,
               our political and religious organizations, our most seemingly casual encounters; in
               our own words and writings and acts and, not least, in our classrooms. I take heart,
               in a desperate time, from the voices resonating throughout this collection—the essayists’
               voices to be sure, but also the voices reclaimed from the archive, and the living
               voices of students and activists and “oracles” quoted so liberally throughout. We
               will need at least another thirty years of remaking Romanticism as a more historically
               accurate, truly representative, and ethically responsible field. This volume points
               the way.</p>
