            <p>This essay reflects on the process of revising Romanticism courses in response to
               student curiosity about how race, primarily Blackness, operates in the period. It
               includes a discussion of how teaching texts by William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
               Amelia Opie, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth reveals to students how the period
               connects race to issues of representation, authorship, gender, and social contracts.
               Sparked by observing how students debate race and representation when it unexpectedly
               appears in their readings from the Romantic period, this essay makes two claims: (1)
               taking up race and representation in the Romanticism classroom is not simply about
               including texts by people of color but is also about recontextualizing the period
               as a whole; and (2) cultivating student interest in Romantic-era racial politics offers
               them a model for how to think about race, representation, and politics in the twenty-first
               century. </p>

                  <p>My decision to design a class that focuses on Romantic-era abolitionist literature
                     was sparked by a student debate about how to interpret William Blake’s “The Little
                     Black Boy.”

                     </div> It was in the spring of 2006, the semester before my tenure file was due and just
                     a few years before the United States elected its first Black president. Students were
                     reading the poem in my fairly traditional Romanticism survey course, one that focused
                     on canonical poets (i.e., the “Big Six”) along with Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> (1818) and <span style="font-style:italic">Valperga</span> (1823). The course paid very little attention to critical discussions about how these
                     same writers responded to debates about England’s participation in the transatlantic
                     slave trade, and for the first three years that I taught Blake’s poem, no student
                     had challenged the line that we ended up discussing for a full 75-minute class period:
                     “And I am black, but O! my soul is white” (line 2). On a handout that included the
                     poem and a few warm-up questions, a student circled the line and wrote: “WTF??!!?”
                     next to it.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>A rambunctious debate that I wasn’t quite prepared to moderate followed. As a specialist
                     in Regency- and Romantic-era fiction, I knew enough about Black figures in eighteenth-
                     and nineteenth-century literature to help students understand the presence of Black
                     people in Romantic-era England.

                     </div> I did not, however, know enough about the politics of race during the Romantic period
                     to help my students think as carefully as I wanted them to about this line. Working
                     through what my students needed to contextualize the line and sorting out how to cultivate
                     the same analytical energy in response to their other readings contributed to this
                     “abolitionist turn” in my teaching of Romanticism. In what follows I show how I made
                     this transition in my undergraduate and graduate courses. I discuss critical essays
                     that have been most useful for students and assignments that can potentially take
                     the work of the class beyond the university classroom.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Threaded through this reflection is an evaluation of how much of the success of these
                  curricular revisions is because of how I responded to students’ unusually animated
                  response to how race operates in the Romantic period. As I explain in my essay “Academic
                  Freedom: Students and the Problem with Labels,” I expend a great deal of energy preserving
                  class discussions as a space where students feel free to wrestle with complex ideas,
                  free from expectations that they reflect a specific political point of view. I aim
                  for what bell hooks calls “a central goal of transformative pedagogy”: making the
                  classroom “a democratic setting where everyone feels a responsibility to contribute”
                  (39). Teaching Romanticism with a focus on abolitionist culture has made this goal
                  easier to reach. I have found that in learning about an abolitionist Romanticism,
                  students are not only studying historical texts and their connection to a literary
                  movement they had not recognized as infused with racialized imagery and philosophy
                  but are also learning more about the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution.</p>
               <p>When I started this process, I faced two obstacles. First, my graduate training, which
                  in 2006 was still the foundation for teaching Romanticism, did not bring questions
                  of race or Blackness to bear on Romanticism. Additionally, as a new professor, I was
                  anxious to teach Romantic poetry in a way that was legible to senior British-literature
                  faculty, especially those who looked askance at my decision to include novels in a
                  course they believed should focus only on poetry. I was also facing a short tenure
                  clock and an institutional environment hostile to faculty of color, realities that
                  left me little time to substantially revise the course I was hired to teach. As a
                  result, my first instinct was simply to add more texts that explicitly included mentions
                  of Black figures or referred to slavery or abolition. This, however, felt like a superficial
                  response to a pedagogical project that required nuance not only in texts I might add
                  to the syllabus but also how those additions would alter students’ understanding of
                  the Romantic period as a whole. To put it simply, would it matter if I added Ottobah
                  Cugoano without thinking about how to reframe “The Little Black Boy” or Blake and
                  his contemporaries?</p>
               <p>In response to this set of concerns, my initial impulse was to read articles and book
                  chapters that focus on how the writers already on the syllabus thought about the slave
                  trade, abolition, amelioration, and emancipation. I also experimented in the undergraduate
                  classes I regularly taught (“Introduction to Theory”; “Art of Fiction”; and “The Novel
                  to 1900”) by introducing new primary texts. I started with just a few texts (primarily
                  fiction) and then planned short units that included abolitionist literature reflecting
                  the overall themes of the courses. A course on women in nineteenth-century literature,
                  for example, included a unit on marriage and chattel slavery. I then offered a “special
                  topics” course that explicitly focused on abolition and the nineteenth century. By
                  2014, when my department added a new required course, “Writing for the Major,” designed
                  for new English majors, I had the materials to plan an entire course that focused
                  on the writers included in my Romanticism syllabus and their contemporaries, in the
                  context of debates about slavery, and this provided an opportunity for students to
                  think about race, abolition, and freedom as essential to how we read literature, regardless
                  of the time period from which it emerges. My goal was to bring this lens to the period
                  not only for special courses but also as a matter of course.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>My student’s visceral response to “And I am black, but O! my soul is white” (or as
                     I came to call it, the “WTF” line) was prompted by a few elements in the poem and
                     gaps in their knowledge about its author. The poem begins, “My mother bore me in the
                     Southern Wild” (line 1). Students reading poems written in the first-person voice
                     often conflate the speaker in the poem with the poem’s author. It is also likely that
                     they had not read the biographical information about Blake included in the anthology.
                     This meant that they did not know who Blake was and whether or not the poem was directly
                     about him. They also did not know if Blake was Black. What follows the “WTF” line
                     shocked students who read it as an exceptionally explicit affirmation of white supremacy:
                     “White as an angel is the English Child / But I am black as if bereaved of light”
                     (lines 4–5). For some students, particularly students of color, a Black author writing
                     these lines reflected a self-loathing. Those same students struggled with a white
                     author comparing white children to angels while denigrating Black skin. Other students
                     read the line as innocuous. They either did not see the problem of the racial hierarchy
                     that the poem promoted or saw such beliefs as historical relics. These initial responses
                     reflect the dominant racial mythologies that held sway in 2006. A diverse group of
                     students in a class on British literature taught by a Black professor were prepared
                     to think that racist ideas prevalent in the nineteenth century had been eradicated
                     by the Civil Rights Movement.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I am fully aware that some students were surprised because they had not completed
                              the reading for the day. This meant they encountered the poem for the first time in
                              class.</span></div>
                     </div> Students who assumed that the author of the poem was Black because of its title interpreted
                     the statement as a sign of self-loathing. They saw a Black speaker denigrating his
                     skin color and valorizing whiteness as the ideal. Other students were willing to allow
                     that attitudes about race in the Romantic period were less enlightened than they imagined
                     them to be in the twenty-first century; however, they also understood that whatever
                     informed nineteenth-century attitudes about race did not mitigate the troubling racial
                     hierarchies the line signified. Barack Obama and the backlash to his candidacy had
                     not entered their field of vision, and, unlike students who studied abolitionist literature
                     with me in subsequent semesters, many of them had not yet been required to confront
                     a world that included the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and to process
                     what the protests in Ferguson, Missouri revealed. Donald Trump was not yet legible
                     to them as a political threat. As I discuss below, Romanticism’s racism felt more
                     contemporary near the end of Obama’s presidency, but in 2006 students turned to historical
                     context and information about Blake and his contemporaries to interpret the line,
                     and they wanted to understand whether or not the language in the poem signified to
                     eighteenth- and nineteenth-century readers what it meant to them in 2006.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Students also asked the same question about Blake that critics defensive of their
                  chosen authors ask when questions of race and racism arise: If the line is racist,
                  should we hold Blake responsible for ideas that were widely, uncritically circulating
                  in the 1800s but unacceptable now? They were also, then, intensely curious to see
                  how his contemporaries wrote about this—if Blake was in step, out of step, or prescient.
                  When I explained that the poem was published at a particularly active time in Britain’s
                  abolitionist movement, students wanted to know which “side” he was on, leading to
                  what, to my mind, was and remains the most important critical point of discussing
                  abolitionist politics. As I explained during that debate and continue to emphasize
                  in my teaching, the terms used in the discussion about the transatlantic slave trade—abolition,
                  emancipation, amelioration, freedom—do not necessarily correlate to notions of antiracism,
                  equality, and equity. It is, I made clear, entirely possible for Blake to be opposed
                  to slavery and still cling to racial hierarchies.</p>
               <p>David Bindman’s “Blake’s Vision of Slavery Revisited” proved an especially useful
                  follow-up to these questions about the poem. Although more recent readings of Blake
                  and race have been published, Bindman’s essay offers a compelling, accessible history
                  that answers students’ questions about Blake’s understanding of race and how consistent
                  it is with the period. Bindman argues that Blake’s poem returns to debates about “the
                  relationship of body to soul that, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, had
                  divided scientists from theologians in the discussion of racial differences,” though
                  he also notes that the “notion that a black body might contain a white soul is expressed
                  at least as early as the third century” (374). Bindman points us to work by Christopher
                  Miller about how skin color was perceived in the Greco-Roman world. Miller cites a
                  third-century C.E. epitaph for an enslaved Ethiopian: “Among the living I was very
                  black, darkened by the rays of the sun, but my soul, ever blooming with white flowers,
                  won my prudent master’s good will” (as cited by Miller, 374). The essay therefore
                  models for students what is required to credibly reach the understanding that Bindman
                  offers near the end of his essay, when he writes that the texts he discusses do not
                  “cast doubt on the sincerity of Blake’s opposition to slavery,” but they do “suggest
                  that Blake was unable to free himself—<span style="font-style:italic">no more than anyone else at the time</span>—from the complex and often contradictory web of ancient and modern beliefs that had
                  settled around Africa and Africans in the late eighteenth century” (382; emphasis
                  added). While I might quibble with the aside that I italicize above—and I share my
                  disagreement with my students—I nonetheless have found Bindman’s essay exceptionally
                  useful in showing students what they might need to think about and the kinds of research
                  they might need to do when considering nineteenth-century representations of race.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Bindman’s article has been a mainstay whenever I teach Blake, and I pair it with Kwame
                     Anthony Appiah’s “Race”—an essay that succinctly traces how race functions as a social
                     construct in the nineteenth century and clearly explains that despite its constructedness,
                     it still carries social weight: “For, however mythical the notion of race seems to
                     be, we cannot deny the obvious fact that having one set of heritable characteristics—dark
                     skin, say—rather than another—blonde hair, for example—can have profound psychological,
                     economic, and other social consequences, especially in societies where many people
                     are not only racialists but racists” (285). Appiah’s assertations here about “heritable
                     characteristics” made some students uncomfortable: those who felt implicated by the
                     idea that the characteristics they were born with have social capital and those who
                     chafed against the idea that their characteristics may not overcome the obstacles
                     they believe can be dismantled with education. My students are wary of the idea of
                     “white privilege” because they associate it with economic wealth, but Appiah in this
                     moment articulates what the “privilege” looks like, quite literally.

                     </div> Despite their discomfort, students responded well to the accessibility of Appiah’s
                     analogies and, as a result, were better prepared to do the more difficult conceptual
                     work it takes to understand how he lays out the consequent process of nation building
                     and understandings of race: “the dual connection made in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                     thought between, on the one hand, race and nationality, and, on the other, nationality
                     and literature”; thus “the nation is the key middle term in understanding the relations
                     between the concept of race and the idea of literature” (282).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Appiah also addresses the impact of the idea of race as a social construction, an
                  idea that too many of my students have turned to as a way to dismiss racism. In the
                  “Writing for the Major” course, students also watched his interview with the editor
                  of <span style="font-style:italic">Foreign Affairs</span>. His observations in the interview prompted open and productive conversations about
                  race and racism in which students’ curiosity about the history of race and earnest
                  desire to understand how racism works overcame some of the defensiveness and anxiety
                  they felt about a topic that became increasingly fraught as their understanding of
                  the world as racially just was undermined by national events.</p>
               <p>Although the “Writing for the Major” course began with “The Little Black Boy,” and
                  other readings included poetry and prose by William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
                  and Robert Southey, the class was less explicitly about Romanticism as a literary
                  period and more about the uses of literary analysis and research to understand the
                  relationship between literature and political movements. The goal was for students
                  to consider how poets and novelists contribute to and shape national debates by paying
                  attention to the rhetoric that abolitionists used to persuade their fellow citizens
                  to support abolition, amelioration, or emancipation. I organized the course around
                  a set of themes that often overlapped: consumer culture, gender, and religious ideology.
                  In addition to reading “The Little Black Boy,” the course began with two exercises:
                  a conversation about the various ways that civic groups try to effect broad change
                  and a low-stakes free-association exercise about the word <span style="font-style:italic">sugar</span>. The exercise involving sugar initially struck them as odd because the commodity
                  they most associate with slavery is cotton. However, in addition to preparing them
                  for the way that the sweetener was integral to abolitionist politics, the free-association
                  exercise helped them understand how a consumable object morphs into the imaginary
                  and metaphoric. Without fail, each time I taught the class the free association began
                  with “honey” and invariably ended with students listing songs that mention “Sugar
                  Daddy” in their titles or lyrics. This conflation of commodity, commerce, and desire
                  prepared them for a discussion of Mick Jagger and Tina Turner’s 1988 performance of
                  “Brown Sugar.” This song, originally released on the Rolling Stones’s 1971 album <span style="font-style:italic">Sticky Fingers,</span> was still familiar to most of them as one they grew up hearing. They may never have
                  seen the Turner-Jagger performance, but they recognize the opening chords and know
                  the start of the chorus. Students watched the video without the benefit of having
                  the lyrics in front of them and then listened to the song again while reading the
                  lyrics. The conversation sparked by what the lines reveal was not as angry as the
                  debate about Blake, but it was intense: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields</div>
                  <div class="l">Sold in the market down in New Orleans</div>
                  <div class="l">Skydog slaver know he’s doin’ all right</div>
                  <div class="l">Hear him whip the women, just around midnight.</div>
               </div>
               <p> I want to be clear here that the point of this exercise was not to hunt for moments
                  of popular culture and vet them for their politics. Instead, I wanted to show students
                  the long reach of the tropes that they were about to encounter. Still, in each class
                  some sort of debate ensued. Some students felt guilty for liking the song. In one
                  class, a few of the Black women tried to convince their classmates that Jagger is
                  satirizing and mocking English history, while others were unsure of what to make of
                  Turner’s full-throated participation in the performance. These early class exercises
                  primed students to push past any neat assumptions about race and abolition in the
                  Romantic period and in contemporary representations of Black women in literature,
                  visual culture, and film. It also prepared them to think along with Christina Sharpe
                  when we listened to her response to Kara Walker’s art installation, “The Subtlety.”
                  Sharpe not only provided a pointed critique of Walker and her use of the Black female
                  form but also offered a model for students about how to ask productive questions from
                  the texts they read and see.</p>
               <p>In addition to “The Little Black Boy,” the primary texts in the class included Coleridge’s
                  1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,” Southey’s six-sonnet sequence “Poems on the Slave
                  Trade,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament; or, How to Make Sugar,” Wordsworth’s
                  “The Mad Mother,” and Hannah More and Eaglesfield Smith’s “The Sorrows of Yamba,”
                  a poem that students found particularly compelling when they were assigned an excerpt
                  from Alan Richardson’s essay about its creation, “‘The Sorrows of Yamba,’ by Eaglesfield
                  Smith and Hannah More: Authorship, Ideology, and the Fractures of Antislavery Discourse.”
                  The excerpt I used from Richardson’s essay was particularly generative. Students read
                  the poem over two class periods. In the first class, their work with the poem was
                  a mix of their initial reactions and my lecture on motherhood and infanticide. On
                  the second day, I used the excerpt from the essay to take students back to the primary
                  text and asked them to identity what in the poem supports Richardson’s claim that
                  he “will establish the dual authorship of the Cheap Repository ‘Sorrows of Yamba’
                  on the basis both of external evidence (including new evidence that I discovered in
                  the course of preparing a collection of British antislavery poems) and internal evidence,”
                  and that “a crucial part of the argument—for the priority and relative integrity of
                  Smith’s version of the poem—depends almost wholly on internal evidence, but of an
                  unusually persuasive kind” (par. 4). This exercise was particularly rewarding for
                  students who had completed the reading before class and followed my recommendation
                  to mark passages they found intriguing and/or troubling. Those who read the poem carefully
                  reported a “feeling” about how it sounded. They couldn’t quite articulate what was
                  happening in the poem until we discussed Richardson’s analysis in class. Having Richardson
                  affirm their initial thinking about the poem not only rewarded their close reading
                  but also opened a dialogue between students and Richardson that didn’t require my
                  guidance.</p>
               <p>Richardson’s analysis was also a useful way to show students the limits of thinking
                  about our primary texts as infallible historical documents. One risk of a course such
                  as this, especially when students start the semester completely unaware of England’s
                  connection to the slave trade, is to read the literary as an historical account of
                  the experiences of the enslaved. My students tended to forget this, but it was especially
                  important for them to think carefully not only about the difference between fact and
                  fiction but also about how the idea of specific audiences shapes the way information
                  is constructed. For example, as they read Olaudah Equiano’s and Mary Prince’s narratives
                  about slavery, I asked them to be mindful of the fact that these histories were written
                  for a white audience.</p>
               <p>These opening exercises gave students a set of signposts to look for as they read,
                  making it easier for their initial encounters with the assigned texts. This made even
                  the most tedious poems, like Opie’s “How to Make Sugar,” manageable, but it didn’t
                  help much with Coleridge’s “Lecture on the Slave Trade.” That essay needs a great
                  deal of glossing to help students understand the many references to people and places
                  they don’t know, and it is written to be heard rather than read. I had to develop
                  a rhetorical map to help students understand it. Many of them believed that Coleridge’s
                  recitation of pro-slavery arguments that he later dismantles were actually his own
                  beliefs and ideas, so we read the lecture as much for the structure of his argument
                  as for his thoughts about the slave trade. Students analyzed the tonal shifts in the
                  essay—from its bombastic opening, to its almost clinical recitation of the arguments
                  for slavery that he is challenging, to its use of poetry. I noted that he is a preacher,
                  a parliamentarian, and a poet all in one lecture and then asked them to identify which
                  moments in the lecture fit under those categories.</p>
               <p>Coleridge's “Lecture on the Slave Trade” provides a useful introduction to Southey’s
                  antislavery sonnet series. In the preface to the six sonnets that grow increasingly
                  violent in tone, Southey speculates about the necessary conditions for the slave trade
                  to end and explains how ending the consumption of West Indian sugar will contribute
                  to its dissolution. After briefly describing the 1792 anti-sugar campaigns, he predicts:
                  “There are yet two other methods remaining, by which this traffic will probably be
                  abolished. By the introduction of East-Indian or Maple Sugar, or by the just and general
                  rebellion of the Negroes; by the vindictive justice of the Africans, or by the civilized
                  Christians finding it in their interest to be humane” (31). Students read Coleridge
                  and Southey about midway through the semester, and Southey’s predictions about the
                  conditions necessary for abolition offered a prompt for them to revisit the question
                  of what mechanisms are required for meaningful societal change.</p>
               <p>When it came to student work in this course, I aimed to develop a series of assignments
                  that reflected how my students imagined their lives after college. When I was a new
                  professor, my writing assignments did not offer students enough options. But a course
                  titled “Writing for the Major” required me to consider new ways to think about what
                  the work of writing does for students and to imagine ways to encourage student agency
                  about their education. In his chapter “Anassignment Letters,” Fred Moten writes to
                  his students about the inherent contradiction of cultivating their intellectual work
                  while imposing institutional structures on them in the form of a series of assignments.
                  The nature of assignments, he explains, neutralizes whatever revolutionary ideals
                  he might hold, leaving him as “nothing other than an overseer even if what [he teaches]
                  appears, at the level of its content, to resist the actually existing political-economic
                  order” (229). Moten wants to mitigate the tension between the coercive practices he
                  sees himself as imposing on his students and his belief that his primary job is to
                  support them as they cultivate and refine their intellectual practices. What this
                  has meant for my praxis is to think of assignments as preparing students to make a
                  choice about how they present their analytical work. Roughly a third of my students
                  have plans to teach English, primarily in high school. Working with them to develop
                  a research-based lesson plan was a useful, organic way to assess how they took primary
                  readings, class discussions, journal articles, and their earlier papers and restructured
                  parts of them for their future students. “The Little Black Boy” lesson plans, for
                  example, took what in a university classroom ends up being two 30-minute class discussions
                  and broke it down into three or four days for younger students.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It was also an instructive glimpse into how my students processed material with an
                     eye toward what they needed from me. They tended to be more interested in providing
                     the “history” around the poem, and they learned how important it is to spend time
                     debunking the myth that historians are simply offering a fixed report of the past.
                     Giving students choices about their writing also amplified their interest in the course
                     readings. They understood that assignments which at first glance felt like busy work
                     actually helped them think about their analytical processes for their final project.
                     The assignment that required them to read two refereed journal articles made more
                     sense to them because it was not simply offering them “context” but also showing them
                     how to engage with complex representations and ideologies.

                              By far the most popular was Brown’s “Olaudah Equiano and the Sailor’s Telegraph.”

               <p>The graduate seminars I teach in my department’s M.A. program are a mix of students
                  planning for doctoral studies, teachers seeking the Master of Arts in Teaching, and
                  students interested in a graduate-level engagement with literature. The course I planned
                  for this group in 2018 provided an opportunity to bring primary texts into dialogue
                  with critical race theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent Romanticist critical
                  discourses that reimagine the postcolonial project. Here is the full description from
                  the syllabus: <span class="quote">‘Students in this course will consider how our understanding of nineteenth-century
                     Britain shifts when we take into account how much of the culture that gave us Percy
                     Bysshe Shelley, Jane Austen, and, eventually, the Brontës relied on the transatlantic
                     slave trade. Our work will focus on Romantic-era writers who shaped, reflected, and
                     contributed to England’s abolitionist movement. We will read antislavery writing by
                     canonical poets (Blake, Coleridge, and Wordsworth); consider the rhetorical moves
                     in Ottobah Cugoano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evils of Slavery </span>[1791] and Olaudah Equiano’s <span style="font-style:italic">Interesting Narrative</span> [1789]; and read novels and novel fragments that tell the story of mixed-race heroines,
                     including <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </span>[1808] and <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam</span> [1838]. We will also read a few antislavery poems and lectures with an eye towards
                     thinking about how representations of people of color are shaped by generic conventions.
                     The abolitionist movement is one of the first political events British white women
                     organized themselves around, so we will pay special attention to nineteenth-century
                     women writers including Jane Austen (<span style="font-style:italic">Sanditon</span> [comp. 1817]), Maria Edgeworth (“The Grateful Negro”), Amelia Opie (<span style="font-style:italic">Adeline Mowbray</span> [1804]), and Mary Wollstonecraft (excerpts from <span style="font-style:italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span> [1792]). In addition to these primary texts, we will also consider the period’s material
                     and visual culture and spend time thinking about how antislavery ideologies are reinterpreted
                     in popular culture. We’ll read these primary texts in the context of Critical Race
                     Theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent Romanticist critical discourses
                     that reimagine the postcolonial project.’</span> In the first few classes, students reacted to this course in a number of ways, almost
                  all of which resisted its premise. Some of this was, I suspect, the natural performance
                  of skepticism that graduate students bring to courses as they feel their way through
                  the dynamics of the class. Some of the resistance was based on how much this course
                  differed from how they had been taught Romanticism as undergraduates. However much
                  they had read of the period before they took my course, these students tended to understand
                  it as a period where there are no Black people or people of color, no questions about
                  identity, race, and citizenship, and where the only revolutionary activities took
                  place in France. Even students sympathetic to the idea of race and representation
                  in the period were skeptical about the seminar, thinking that my approach to our reading
                  was a theoretical or temporal sleight of hand. This was one of the reasons I didn’t
                  begin this course with Wordsworth’s “To Toussaint L’Ouverture.” With its “whistling
                  rustic” and “common wind,” Wordsworth’s sonnet reads to students as consistent with
                  Romantic tropes in general and the aesthetics of his work. When we did read the poem
                  later in the semester, we followed it with C. L. R James’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Black Jacobins</span> (1938), which helped reorient students to the geographies of slavery and abolition.
                  For students trained in African American studies, this class was a revelation that
                  invited them to revisit the “trans” in “transatlantic slave trade.” For so many of
                  them the history of the transatlantic slave trade has elided England’s role in it
                  and the hollowness of “emancipation.”</p>
               <p>The most animated class discussions were sparked by <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</span> (1808). Even though they preferred reading novels to poetry, graduate students loved
                  and hated <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span> in equal measure. The novel, which tells the story of the daughter of an enslaved
                  Black woman and a planter with family in England, disrupts their expectations of both
                  the “tragic mulatto” narrative and the courtship novel. Many students confessed that
                  they wanted the heroine, Olivia Fairfield, to recover from her marriage to a bigamist
                  by marrying an early suitor in the novel and wrestled with their own need for a happy
                  ending that concludes with nuptials rather than the independence that comes with being
                  a wealthy woman who returns with no master—chattel to no man, free from her father’s
                  bizarre will requiring her to marry a distant cousin in order to inherit, emancipated
                  from the racist strictures of British society—to her home in Jamaica. In response
                  to the revelation that Olivia’s supposed husband, August Merton, already has a wife,
                  her servant Dido announces that she “<span style="font-style:italic">has no</span> master” after the biracial heroine discovers that her husband is an accidental bigamist
                  (141). Dido is not only furious about how her mistress has been treated by her husband’s
                  family but is also frustrated to find herself demoted from a grand home to a more
                  modest cottage. We thought about the idea of a “master” in multiple registers—as the
                  titular head of a wealthy English home and, given that Dido is from Jamaica and marked
                  linguistically as other, as a man who bought and sold captured African women and men
                  or could claim legal ownership from birth. We also thought about Dido’s body and the
                  space she and Olivia occupy materially and imaginatively in the novel. The text’s
                  inflections of marriage and/as slavery and women and/as chattel underscored our discussions
                  of all the fiction we read. We compared Olivia to Wollstonecraft’s description of
                  ideal women in <span style="font-style:italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span>.</p>
               <p>Student resistance to the course’s central goal diminished as the semester progressed,
                  but it was replaced by an intellectual sentimentalism that I found reductive. In my
                  essay on a similar subject (“Jane Austen and the Abolitionist Turn”), I talk about
                  the collegial but earnest tug-of-war I have with graduate students who want to make
                  the work of reading about race and representation in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                  Britain into a cause. While I admire the intentions behind this idea, I find I am
                  ambivalent about some of the projects that emerge from this stance. This is in part
                  a reaction to the way such an approach is framed. Projects that work to question our
                  assumptions about Romanticism and its entanglements with race and representation make
                  sense. These interrogations tend to stay tightly focused, and they rely on the kind
                  of archival thinking that a scholar like Rebecca Schneider deploys in her essay “‘He
                  says he is free’: Narrative Fragments and Self-Emancipation in West Indian Runaway
                  Advertisements.” I worry about an approach that treats these works as ways to “humanize”
                  people of color by reading the primary texts (the literary and the historical) as
                  documentaries that teach us about the past. They don’t. They show us select representations
                  of the past. As Marcus Wood observes in his study of visual representations of slavery,
                  “The experiences of millions of individuals who were the victims of slavery is not
                  collectable; it is unrecoverable as a set of relics. There can be no archeology of
                  the memory of slavery that corresponds to an emotional identification with a lost
                  reality” (7). Those representations certainly influence our contemporary notions of
                  race, but Britain’s abolitionist project feels too complex to be read as a template
                  for what we can and cannot do in the twenty-first century. It is a viewpoint that
                  is appealing to students who are less interested in literary analysis and more invested
                  in sociological projects. The problem with this approach is that it replicates the
                  same problematic assumptions about who we read, so that writers are good or bad depending
                  on how they feed into our notions of social justice. As I discuss below by way of
                  conclusion, this is different than the connections my undergraduates make between
                  abolitionist-era politics and this contemporary moment. Despite reading many of the
                  same texts, undergraduates tend to identify structural similarities between the two
                  periods, especially the way that British abolitionists construct themselves in relationship
                  to the Black figures they claim to support. Graduate students, especially women of
                  color and white women, tend to see in the struggles of the past their own oppressive
                  experiences.</p>
               <p>One way this is evident is in reactions to Olivia Fairfield in <span style="font-style:italic">The Woman of Colour</span>. Whereas, as I note above, graduate students wrestle with wanting a traditional,
                  heteronormative ending for Olivia, undergraduates are exasperated with her for not
                  confronting the bigotry she encounters. They tend to have no interest in the idea
                  of her marrying. They see that legal and social contracts have failed her, and their
                  focus tends to stay on that fact. The different responses certainly reflect when and
                  how students engage with this material. Undergraduates are still developing the analytic
                  skills that graduate students are refining on the way to planning longer projects
                  that will make critical interventions into existing discourse. Their different reactions
                  also reflect the readings that students bring to the class. In the graduate seminar,
                  most of the students were very familiar with Regency-era literature and read it by
                  choice. I think that for them Olivia Fairfield was a brown version of the white heroines
                  they read for pleasure and for escape. Undergraduates encountered her in the context
                  of abolitionist debates. As a result, they see her as yet another person of color
                  navigating nineteenth-century racism. Generally speaking, perhaps both groups are
                  simply projecting their own values onto the text, and I prefer the projection that
                  aligns with my own thinking. I get excited when I see my students recognizing patterns
                  of structural violence and nervous when they individualize what they read in my classes.
                  The latter seems to me more a starting point than the end of an intellectual project.
                  This seems a good pedagogical problem to have; in both cases students are animated
                  about and engaged with the work of understanding an ecosystem that they still see
                  as operating today.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">* * *</span></h2>
               <p>I want students to see my class discussions—indeed, my class as a whole—as a place
                  to work out ideas and a space free from punitive critique and the pressure to perform
                  a particular politics. I have been gratified when they make connections between our
                  reading and the contemporary political landscape, and I have been relieved when they
                  feel they can talk about their political concerns in my class. What I admired about
                  the student’s “WTF??!!?” has happened in classes again, in more muted but no less
                  intense ways. After the 2016 election, many of the students who enrolled in my section
                  of “Writing for the Major” did so because they saw it as a space where they could
                  talk about the racist violence they saw in the country. The words “Black Lives Matter”
                  were never spoken. But Black students in the class were very open about the fear they
                  felt. I will always remember the Black woman who said, “I feel like I have to fight
                  the same battles my ancestors already won.” The white students around her were visibly
                  shocked by her candor. With no prompting from me, students in the class were more
                  likely to choose research projects that connected representations of violence in abolitionist
                  culture to violence they were reading about in the news. One student, for example,
                  wrote a research essay about Equiano’s description of psychological violence and the
                  case of Kalief Browder, wrongly imprisoned after police suspected him of stealing
                  a backpack. Another student prepared a research presentation that traced depictions
                  of Black women’s bodies from Sarah Baartman to the present, revisiting Christina Sharpe’s
                  discussion of Kara Walker. Among themselves, students started discussing the challenges
                  and risks of confronting racist moments in their lives away from school. Ava DuVernay’s
                  documentary <span style="font-style:italic">13</span><sup>th</sup> was released in October 2016; by 2017 some of my students had watched the film, and
                  they brought it up enough in class discussions that their peers watched it, too.</p>
               <p>There were difficult debates, as well. Smart, thoughtful students asked earnest questions
                  with racist overtones, and I had to walk a fine line. I had to moderate those discussions
                  without giving students who were asking troubling questions the impression that they
                  were being dismissed, and while also protecting the sensibilities of other students
                  who would feel those questions most keenly because of their “heritable characteristics.”
                  In those discussions, Coleridge’s lecture was quite helpful. He lays out five pro-slavery
                  arguments and then debunks them. In more than one class, skeptical students benefitted
                  from our close attention to what underscored the pro-slavery debates that Coleridge
                  references.</p>
               <p>In the scant ground of a course reading list, it can be particularly challenging to
                  include new authors, especially if one wants to go about the work with care. As Miriam
                  Wallace and I noted in our <span style="font-style:italic">Romantic Circles</span> special issue (2008), Annette Kolodny is right when she describes the challenges
                  of changing what and how we teach: “Radical breaks are tiring, demanding, uncomfortable,
                  and sometimes wholly beyond our comprehension” (12). But I think the outcomes are
                  worth the effort, and no one taking on this work is doing so alone. There are so many
                  resources available and models to follow. I am thinking especially of the <span style="font-style:italic">Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</span> digital humanities project (2020). The site is a repository of peer-reviewed syllabi,
                  recorded discussions about teaching, and sample units for faculty use. Similar projects
                  are in the works for eighteenth-century studies as well. An abolitionist Romanticism
                  course captures most students’ imaginations because they tend to think of slavery
                  and abolition as uniquely American. Thinking about race, racism, and slavery in a
                  British context gives them space to work out knotty, unnerving questions about these
                  complex issues. At the same time, it helps them read contemporary progressive movements
                  in more nuanced ways. I have found that in learning about an abolitionist Romanticism,
                  students are not only studying historical texts and their connection to a movement,
                  they are also learning more about the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution.</p>

               Students tend to find Equiano particularly compelling, and Brown’s reading of the
