                <p>Reading through this collection of original essays, I have found myself struck again and
                again at the ingenious and telling ways contributors have chosen to deploy,
                disorder, and invert chronology. The inversions begin with the trenchant
                introduction by the editors, Joselyn M. Almeida and Amelia Worsley, who move
                strategically backward from the racist assaults on Black lives in the present-day
                United States, through a series of twentieth- and twenty-first-century interventions
                in Romantic scholarship, before leaping back to the British Romantic era itself. I
                will take a somewhat different tack (or rather, series of tacks) through the
                timeline, beginning almost thirty-five years ago before moving to consider the six
                essays that follow Almeida and Worsley’s lead.</p>
                
            <p>In 1990, then, I put out a call for papers for a special MLA session on “Africa in
                the Romantic Imagination”—so far as I knew, or yet know, the first session of its
                kind. The call mentioned not only representations of sub-Saharan Africa, but also of
                race, of slavery in the Americas, of antislavery writing, of the African diaspora in
                England. I cast the net widely. To small avail. Although I issued the call at the
                earliest possible time, over the months of waiting I received a single unsolicited
                proposal. Working my network of friends and colleagues in the profession, I managed
                to drum up one other and then added a proposal of my own, an early version of the
                article that introduced the topic of obeah to Romantic studies (Richardson,
                “Romantic Voodoo”). The session was accepted by the MLA convention committee. It
                drew a small but, as I choose to remember it, an appreciative audience.</p>
                
            <p>No one could read through the introduction to the present collection, let alone the
                essays that follow, without understanding the Romantic era—let’s call it
                1780–1838—as the chronological period that saw the height of the British slave
                trade, a growing British colonial empire fueled by slavery, a burgeoning Black
                population in Britain itself, mass movements advocating abolition and emancipation
                (the first mass political movements in British history), an outpouring of
                antislavery writings of many kinds, and a series of slave uprisings and rebellions
                in the British “sugar islands.” And so it was. And yet, in 1990, all this had long
                remained virtually invisible to mainstream Romantic scholarship to date: hardly
                unthinkable, but rarely thought of. That same year, I published an essay on William
                Blake’s “The Little Black Boy” in relation to issues of race and colonial slavery
                (Richardson, “Colonialism”). Researching that piece I found, much to my amazement,
                that no one had ever thought to publish such an essay before, and that Blake
                scholars had not bothered to ask what Blake meant by the “southern wild” or what had
                brought this imagined Black boy into contact with his “little English” counterpart.
                How, I wondered, was this astounding lack of interest—not to say intellectual
                responsibility—even possible?</p>
                
            <p>Folding this particular, and particularly glaring, absence into a larger evasion of
                history and politics characteristic of Romanticism as it was long taught and studied
                will not do. As David Perkins demonstrated in detail some time ago, what came to be
                called the “Romantic Movement” had been tightly linked with the energies of the
                French Revolution as early as 1802 (by Francis Jeffrey), a linkage that had become a
                “critical commonplace” by the Victorian era (88–90, 99–103). Between William
                Wordsworth’s “levelling muse,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s notorious
                radical-to-conservative arc, Lord Byron’s consistent (his only consistent) ideal of
                “liberty,” and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s outspoken radicalism, Romantic scholarship
                never forgot the impact of European revolutionary politics for long. But the slave
                trade, colonial slavery, the antislavery movement and its vast literature, the
                contributions of Black writers: this history long remained invisible.</p>
                
            <p>Not because the relevant information and trustworthy pointers to the archival record
                would have been hard to find. One needed only turn to Eva Beatrice Dykes’s <hi
                    rend="italic">The Negro in Romantic Thought</hi> (1942) and Wylie Sypher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Guinea’s Captive Kings</hi> (1942)—yet for half a century
                practically no one did. David V. Erdman’s <hi rend="italic">Blake: Prophet against
                    Empire</hi> (1954), the most prominent book to challenge the field’s aversion to
                issues of race, slavery, and colonialism, did not penetrate very far out of the
                tight circle of Blake scholarship and, even there, remained eclipsed by the
                mythopoeic approaches of Northrop Frye and Harold Bloom until rediscovered during
                the new historicist turn of the 1980s and 1990s. And, even then, Romantic
                scholarship lagged behind its neighboring fields: eighteenth-century scholars like
                Moira Ferguson and Victorianists like Patrick Brantliger were publishing important
                studies on antislavery writing, British exploitation of Africa, and the rise of
                modern racism by the mid-1980s, at a time when Henry Louis Gates Jr. began drawing
                critical attention to (as well as republishing) early Black British writers like
                Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince (both included in Gates’s 1987 volume, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Classic Slave Narratives</hi>).</p>
                
            <p>How else, then, to account for the history of erasure that I and, as it turned out, a
                few scattered Romanticist colleagues found ourselves confronting in 1990? Diagnosing
                a different set of erasures—of the sensibility and sentimental modes so crucial to
                the emergence of anything meaningfully called “Romanticism” and, in particular, of
                the female poets who helped develop them, Jerome McGann noted how a history of
                “reading romanticism through its most conservative venues” had effectively repressed
                critical attention to the “poetics of sensibility” (2). So effectively, indeed, that
                Romanticists had not only failed to read these poets and poetic modes but had lost
                the ability to meaningfully read them at all. From the perspective of 2024, we can
                add that influential constructions of Romanticism, from the Victorian era through
                nearly the end of the twentieth century, were not only masculinist in tendency but
                racist and white supremacist as well. Whatever the Romantic archive held, whatever
                the various (and often changing) views espoused by the literally thousands of
                writers active during that fraught half century, one retrospective version of the
                field after another, in anthologies, in literary histories, in critical studies, in
                class syllabi, rendered the Black lives of the era invisible, including the millions
                of Black lives sacrificed to kidnapping, the Middle Passage, colonial slavery, and
                early death. None of this mattered.</p>
                
            <p>An essay that came out in 1989 both diagnosed and illustrated the problem. In a
                critical examination of Wordsworth’s apathetic response to the movement against the
                “traffickers in Negro blood” (1805 <hi rend="italic">Prelude</hi> 10.206), Mary
                Jacobus located a “historical repression” of the slave trade endemic to “high
                Romantic discourse” (69, 90). But Jacobus failed sufficiently to note that “high”
                Romanticism was and always had been a retrospective construct, the culling of a few
                hundred “essential” texts from a vast archive, a selection, as we have noted,
                motivated in part both by masculinist and racist agendas. Hence “high” Romanticism
                could by definition never include the era’s significant outpouring of antislavery
                literature, a great deal of it contributed by women writers. This reification of a
                purely contingent canon and construction of the field operated well into the
                twentieth century (when “high” Romanticism had, in retrospect almost bizarrely,
                become confined largely to selected works by six male poets). Perversely enough, the
                same reification even informs the first book-length study of Romanticism and slavery
                to appear since Dykes’s 1942 book, <hi rend="italic">Mind-Forg’d Manacles</hi>
                (1994), in which the author, Joan Baum, pointedly differentiates “propaganda” verse
                from the “essential contribution of the Romantics,” whose “<hi rend="italic"
                    >genius</hi>” was to “<hi rend="italic">avoid palpable or overt</hi>” moral
                engagement (xi, 69, caption to figure 13). Case closed.</p>
                
            <p>So the academic field of British Romanticism, in 1990, badly needed reconstruction: a
                project that would take decades of critical work, the latest phase of which this
                volume embodies. Earlier phases—still far from complete—have involved several
                related strategies. One has concerned a combination of archival research and the
                republishing of works long kept out of circulation, as a necessary corrective to
                both the progressive narrowing of the Romantic canon and the field’s longstanding
                refusal to account for Black voices and Black lives. <hi rend="italic">Slavery,
                    Abolition, and Emancipation: Writings in the British Romantic Period</hi>
                (1999), the capacious eight-volume set assembled by Peter Kitson and Debbie Lee,
                stands as the major accomplishment along these lines to date. I would note here as
                well the collections of early Black British writing and the anthologies of
                antislavery verse listed by Almeida and Worsley in their introductory survey. Most
                of these works needed not simply to be republished (in print or online) but edited
                and introduced—made usable to scholars and students encountering them for the first
                time. This effort, as I can personally attest, has often involved a good deal of
                primary research, as even some of the most basic questions of authorship,
                publication history, and early reception had remained murky for over a century and a
                half. Important Romantic-era authors like Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, Mary
                Birkett, and Edward Rushton, for example, had become little more than names attached
                to titles in rare books collections before Romantics scholars began undertaking this
                work of recovery in earnest in the 1990s, building on research by pioneers in other
                fields like Gates, Ferguson, and David Dabydeen.</p>
                
            <p>A second strategy has involved moving “beyond formalism” in a double sense. As part
                of breaking away from notions of a “high” or “essential” Romanticism virtually
                untethered from its human context, the field needed to recruit new reading
                methodologies not only from the “new” historicism but, in this case, from such
                fields as colonial discourse studies, critical race theory, cultural criticism, and
                postcolonial studies as well. The imaginary (not to mention arbitrary and unstable)
                line between literature and ideology, “poetry” and “propaganda,” needed to be
                repeatedly challenged. And “beyond formalism,” as well, in Geoffrey Hartman’s sense
                that formalism (as in the American New Criticism) had not been “formalistic enough”
                (542). New reading strategies could reveal new tensions, contradictions, and
                interventions in texts that had been robbed of their full ideological force through
                interpretative methods designed to yield up well-wrought, “organic” poetic wholes.
                In the case of my own work, this doubly post-formalist poetics meant, for instance,
                locating the play of distinct voices in Blake’s “The Little Black Boy”—the
                Afrocentric voice of the mother, the jarring voice of internalized oppression, the
                emergent yet highly fragile ideological consciousness of the child speaker
                himself—and noting the possibilities arising from the contradictions among them. Or
                locating the stylistic and ideological fractures in “The Sorrows of Yamba”—a popular
                text for recent republishing efforts—that ultimately revealed the hand of two
                distinct authors (Richardson, “‘Sorrows of Yamba’”). These two strategies for moving
                past formalism can effectively complement one another in the classroom, as several
                essays in this volume attest.</p>
                
            <p>From one perspective, such strategies reflected a willingness to bring the ethical
                and political concerns of the present to bear on the histories and literary
                artifacts of the past. And, indeed, some of us were accused at the time of critical
                “anachronism,” of the “condescension of the present,” as though Romantic-era writers
                like Cugoano had never advanced cogent antiracist arguments, as though literally
                thousands of pamphlets, broadsides, and poems had not been written condemning
                slavery and the slave trade, as though even a conservative like Hannah More had not
                denounced the capture and forced transport of millions of Africans on the grounds of
                “human rights” (<hi rend="italic">Slavery, a Poem</hi>, line 260). Yet, from a
                different perspective, such work might be seen as a corrective to and thickening of
                the traditional Romantic chronology. Adding in historical dates like 1772
                (Mansfield’s <hi rend="italic">Somerset</hi> decision), 1781 (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> massacre), 1788 (the first great outpouring of antislavery agitation,
                petitions, and writings), 1791 (the Haitian Revolution), 1795–96 (the second Maroon
                War in Jamaica), 1807 (the abolition of the slave trade), 1823 (the Demerara slave
                revolt), and 1831 (the “Christmas” rebellion in Jamaica). Adding in literary dates
                like 1773 (Phillis Wheatley Peters’s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>), 1782 (Ignatius
                Sancho’s <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>), 1786 (Thomas Clarkson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species</hi>), 1787 (Cugoano’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments</hi>), 1789 (Equiano’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi>), 1817 (Robert Wedderburn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Axe Laid to the Root</hi>), and 1831 (Prince’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi>). Asserting, as the end date to the “Romantic period” construct
                itself, the claims of the Emancipation year 1838, marking the abandonment of the
                “Apprenticeship” program and the effective end of slavery in the British West Indian
                colonies.</p>
                
            <p>Yet thirty years of such remedial work—filling in gaps, adding texts and authors,
                reading more historically and more critically—have only done so much. As Almeida and
                Worsley note in their introduction, while we now have a “somewhat” expanded canon,
                antislavery writing still occupies at best a “marginal position” in Romantic
                pedagogy, with just a few (increasingly predictable) additions to course syllabi and
                too little attention to innovative classroom interventions. And so, to return to my
                initial impression of this volume’s own series of interventions, the Romantic
                chronology needs not just filling in but creative disruption, rearrangement,
                inversion, juxtaposition. Strict chronology—despite attempts to render it more
                faithful—has gone out of date.</p>
                
            <p>Again, we see the first gesture toward rethinking chronology in the editors’
                decision, in their introduction, to work backward and “explore how the present
                moment informs the ways that students might currently receive Romantic texts.” This
                should not be viewed as an attempt to make our courses more “relatable” (and perhaps
                increase our market share of bodies in the classroom), although that might prove a
                kind of side-effect of our revisionary efforts. Rather, we would be doing our
                students an acute disservice, and allowing ourselves to appear aridly out of touch,
                were we to pretend that issues of racism, racial violence and oppression, Black
                agency, and the value of Black lives were somehow <hi rend="italic">not</hi> living
                and pressing matters. We would also be robbing our students of a chance to study the
                genealogy of our critical situation today in events, practices, and ideologies that
                were salient in the period we study and teach—however long they remained repressed
                from our field’s scholarly consciousness. If this is “presentism,” it is a frank
                acknowledgment of our present concerns and perspectives that better reveals, rather
                than distorts, the long-occluded record of the Romantic past.</p>
                
            <p>Patricia A. Matthew, in her essay on “Romanticism and the Abolitionist Turn,” aptly
                characterizes the classroom sense of the Romantic era passed on to my own generation
                of scholars: “a period where there are no Black people or people of color, no
                questions about identity, race, and citizenship, and where the only revolutionary
                activities took place in France.” And she argues forcefully that no merely
                chronological approach to the past as somehow disconnected from these questions as
                posed in our own moment will suffice to reorient our, and our students’, attention.
                As Matthew stresses, primary texts do not “teach us about the past” but rather “show
                us select representations of the past”; historians as well can never offer a “fixed
                report of the past” but only a reconstruction inevitably informed by living concerns
                and debates. By insisting throughout her essay on past documents and timelines as
                    <hi rend="italic">representations</hi>, Matthew offers another way to contest
                positivist notions of history and implicitly white supremacist accounts of the
                field.</p>
                
            <p>Nicolas Blaisdell provides first-person evidence of how encountering antislavery
                writing in a college classroom setting can stimulate and inform social justice
                activism in the present, which then in turn feeds into more robust antiracist
                pedagogical strategies. In keeping with this volume’s frequent recourse to
                chronological inversion, Blaisdell begins with an incident from July 2020, an
                encounter between a group of Black Lives Matter activists and officers from the
                Peabody, Massachusetts police department: a beginning that immediately suggests
                continuities between then and now, and a porousness between “academic” pursuits and
                action in the world. Intriguingly, Blaisdell traces his political activism back to
                his classroom exposure to two early Black British writers, Cugoano and Prince, along
                with the critique of early Victorian laissez-faire capitalism developed by Friedrich
                Engels. Key to Blaisdell’s own critique is his view of slavery not simply as a past
                artifact to study but as a tradition of racialized oppression persisting in such
                twenty-first-century forms as “unfree prison labor, unfree migrant labor, and unfree
                international labor.” Just as significantly, Blaisdell traces the emergence of his
                own antiracist activism to the inspiration of texts and events from the Romantic
                past, when abolitionist groups organized “unprecedented petitions, protests, legal
                proceedings, and other forms of civic action.” His story bears powerful witness to
                the dynamic potential residing in the encounter of the artefactual past, the current
                pursuit of racial and economic justice, and the college classroom.</p>
                
            <p>In his meditation on “Teaching Antislavery,” Sean Gordon draws on theories of
                Afropessimism to drive home a comparable insistence on the continuities between the
                Romantic era and the moment we find ourselves in today. “I wanted students to engage
                with this continuum,” he writes, “to question their assumptions about the ‘pastness’
                of slavery, the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism
                of the Obama administration.” To this end, Gordon stretches inherited notions of
                Romanticism both geographically and chronologically. Geographically—by including a
                late Romantic American author like Edgar Allan Poe and by implicitly acknowledging
                the pointlessness of trying to circumscribe so cosmopolitan a writer as Equiano
                within a British, American, or transatlantic tradition: his career in fact exposes
                the arbitrariness of such categories. Chronologically—in bringing out the dialogue
                between Romantic texts and various later texts that demonstrate, in their own ways,
                the presentness of the past, including Mat Johnson’s twenty-first-century response
                to Poe in <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, as well as fiction by Octavia Butler, Samuel
                Delany, and Celu Amberstone. Because the Black protagonist of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pym</hi> begins the novel as an English professor, Gordon’s syllabus also helps
                break down any imagined sense of “college” as a cloistered space somehow insulated
                from the racist ideologies and the incidents of racially motivated violence swirling
                all around it—and, as Gordon’s opening demonstrates, within it. As we attempt to
                track the major dates we transit through in Gordon’s essay—2014, 2015, 2011, 1838,
                2004, 1995, 1966, 1789—chronology becomes not a series of beads on a string
                distantly linking then and now but a flexible story line, with flashbacks and
                fast-forwards, foreshadowings and back projections. Freed from the remorselessness
                of chronological succession, Gordon’s students can make their own dynamic
                connections among current, past, and personally experienced events and the literary
                texts that variously represent or refract them.</p>
                
            <p>Chronological inversions can involve a matter of years or a matter of centuries, as
                Elizabeth Fay’s essay makes clear. Teaching Prince’s <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
                (1831) in advance of Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> (1789),
                while “achronological,” encourages students to encounter Equiano’s more distanced,
                “rhetorically sophisticated” narrative only after registering the powerfully
                visceral impact of Prince’s account. (Fay also exposes her students to first-person
                historical accounts to increase their chances of sensing the “gut-level pain” of
                colonial slavery.) Fay’s pedagogy, like Gordon’s, also extends chronology beyond the
                present, including “Afrofuturist” works like Ryan Coogler’s <hi rend="italic">Black
                    Panther</hi> film (2018). And, as Ivan Ortiz demonstrates in an especially
                resonant essay, chronology can be pushed backward as well. Asking what it might mean
                to sing an antislavery ballad to the tune of “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Ortiz invites
                his students, and us, to hear the “haunting” of abolitionist verse by prior,
                colonialist voices, a “white noise” that may function to obliterate the otherness of
                the enslaved subject. His hauntological analysis helps us understand the limits of
                sympathy—now as then—which may forestall rather than facilitate an “authentic
                encounter with human otherness.”</p>
                
            <p>Expanding on what Fay calls her achronological strategy, Frances Botkin, borrowing
                from Jamaican Creole, develops a critical and pedagogical approach she terms <hi
                    rend="italic">tunyuhan</hi>. Following the Jamaican Maroon practice of making do
                    (<hi rend="italic">mek fashion</hi>) with what comes to hand (<hi rend="italic"
                    >tun yu han</hi>, turn your hand), Botkin draws on an eclectic array of
                materials—“borrowing from other fields, experimenting with different genres, and
                branching into other centuries”—to fill in the silences and reveal the distortions
                endemic even to Black British writing, highly mediated as it was, in the Romantic
                era. Her resources include living Maroon oral traditions—and living Maroon speakers
                and activists. Botkin exposes her students to “knowledge beyond the archive” in an
                effort to incorporate living voices and ultimately “remake Romanticism.”</p>
                
            <p>It might be said that every generation of Romantic scholars and teachers remakes the
                field, but not often, and perhaps not ever, so radically as over the past
                thirty-five to forty-five years of canon revision and critical reorientation. Women
                writers are now, for the first time, well represented in anthologies and teaching
                syllabi. Black writers and antislavery writing remain marginal to the field as a
                whole, yet the reparative work begun in the 1990s continues and the present volume
                does much to advance it. And recent events have shown just how urgent and how vital
                such work has grown.</p>
                
            <p>I first read these essays at around the time of the now infamous attack on the U.S.
                Congress as it met to ratify the electoral college results of the 2020 presidential
                election on January 6, 2021. A large mob of right-wing rioters broke into the
                Capitol Building, seeking to disrupt the count, perhaps to murder any number of
                Democratic legislators, and bearing with them Confederate flags, Crusader crosses,
                nooses, and other white nationalist emblems, while sporting an odd combination of
                tactical apparel and Trump campaign gear. It was an attempted coup motivated by
                racist and white supremacist ideologies and egged on by the outgoing (at last)
                President himself. In the aftermath of this brazen attack on American democracy, no
                one any longer has an excuse for branding efforts such as those offered in this
                volume as “presentism” or as performative “wokeness” or as some passing academic
                leftist fad. All of us are now called to examine the racism and white supremacism
                operative, subtly or not, in our professions and workplaces, our political and
                religious organizations, our most seemingly casual encounters; in our own words and
                writings and acts and, not least, in our classrooms. I take heart, in a desperate
                time, from the voices resonating throughout this collection—the essayists’ voices to
                be sure, but also the voices reclaimed from the archive, and the living voices of
                students and activists and “oracles” quoted so liberally throughout. We will need at
                least another thirty years of remaking Romanticism as a more historically accurate,
                truly representative, and ethically responsible field. This volume points the
                way.</p>
