                <p>
                    Urgent questions remain regarding what it means to teach anti-slavery and abolitionist texts in the current moment, 
                    despite the field of Romanticism’s reassessment of its complicity in and resistance to Atlantic slavery and its global repercussions. 
                    The introduction offers some context for the 2018 roundtable on teaching Romantic abolitionist and anti-slavery literatures amidst the 
                    Black Lives Matter movement that gave rise to this essay collection. In Romanticism and Anti-Slavery Literatures: Pedagogies and Contexts, 
                    Patricia Mathew, Ivan Ortiz, Elizabeth Fay, Sean Gordon, Frances Botkin, and Nicholas Blaisdell explore various approaches to teaching 
                    abolitionist and anti-slavery literature of the long nineteenth century, and directly describe their experiences in the classroom with a 
                    series of case studies. Many of them argue that it is not enough to teach abolitionist texts from the period without also engaging contemporary 
                    perspectives on the legacies of slavery. Others articulate linkages that connect their teaching praxis with histories of resistance and 
                    liberation, even as they also seek to problematize this linkage. Drawing of the work of scholars such as Simon Gikandi, Edward Said, and 
                    Fernando Ortíz, the editors offer a meditation on 'contrapuntal reading' as theoretical framework that further elucidates what the contributors 
                    collectively achieve. The responses by Alan Richardson and Debbie Lee consider this intervention within the larger pedagogical conversation of 
                    the last thirty years and the directions of inquiry it suggests for scholars and teachers.

              <p> Many crucial developments have emerged in the field of Romanticism since the
                2018 roundtable event on "Romantic Abolition Literatures: Pedagogies and Contexts" that prompted this collection.<note place="foot" resp="author"> We must acknowledge, in fairness
                            to our contributors, that the collection was in stasis while the <hi
                                rend="italic">Romantic Circles</hi> website was rebuilt and
                            concurrent projects were under way. Although some contributors have
                            added references to more recent work for the purpose of citational
                            justice, the majority of these essays were drafted in 2019 and
                        2020.</note> One particularly salient example of this
                field-changing work is the series “Race, Blackness, and Romanticism: Dialogues,”
                cosponsored in spring 2021 by the Boston Area Romanticist Colloquium and the
                University at Buffalo, hosted by Patricia A. Matthew, one of the contributors to

                                Pedagogy as Ethical

                Yet many questions remain about how to recalibrate classroom praxis in light of
                urgent historical events.</p>
                
            <p>To the degree that the essays gathered here posit contrapuntal strategies in the
                teaching and reading of the archive of Romanticism and its multiple relations to
                slavery and to abolitionist and antislavery literatures, they are expanding the turn
                to contrapuntal reading, a method that Fernando Ortiz, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contrapunteo cubano del tabaco y el azúcar</hi> (1940), and Edward Said, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Culture and Imperialism</hi> (1993), advanced independently of
                each other. In turn, this approach has influenced the work of writers like the Cuban
                novelist Alejo Carpentier as well as critics such as Mary Louise Pratt and Simon
                Gikandi. In <hi rend="italic">Slavery and the Culture of Taste</hi>
                (2011), Gikandi uses contrapuntal
                reading to advance epistemologies and pedagogies that pluralize received hierarchies
                of knowledge and decenter the hegemony of an archive and its exclusionary categories—an approach to which
                our contributors are also committed.</p>
                
            <p>In the Anglo-American academy, scholars and students may be familiar with how Said
                theorizes the importance of reading “not univocally but <hi rend="italic"
                    >contrapuntally</hi>, with a simultaneous awareness both of the metropolitan
                history that is narrated and of those other histories against which (and together
                with which) the dominating discourse acts”
                (<hi rend="italic">Culture and Imperialism</hi>51). Drawing on music to
                describe a way of reading novels such as Jane Austen’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi> (1814), he writes:
                
            <quote>In the counterpoint of Western classical music, various themes play off one another,
                with only a provisional privilege being given to any particular one; yet in the
                resulting polyphony there is concert and order, an organized interplay that derives
                from the themes, not from a rigorous melodic or formal principle outside the work.
                In the same way, I believe, we can read and interpret English novels, for example,
                whose engagement (usually suppressed for the most part) with the West Indies or
                India, say, is shaped and perhaps even determined by the specific history of
                colonization, resistance, and finally native nationalism. (51)</quote>
                
            While Said’s archive was “English novels,” Ortiz applied <hi rend="italic"
                    >contrapunteo</hi> in his anthropological analysis of sugar and tobacco (written
                roughly fifty years prior to Said’s work) and coined the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >transculturación</hi> (transculturation) by now familiar to critics through the
                work of Pratt. It should be noted that Ortiz and his generation, which included
                Lydia Cabrera, the renowned scholar of <hi rend="italic">santería</hi>, and
                Carpentier, who turned to the Haitian Revolution for inspiration, embarked on a
                reassessment of the contributions of Afro-Cuban and African cultures to Cuban
                identity. Counterpoint becomes both metaphor and method for Ortiz, who emphasizes
                the musical roots of the contrapuntal while he underscores the Afro-Cuban
                experience, one that incorporates both music <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the orality
                of verse in call-and-response rituals between griot and audience. He writes,
                “Recordemos en Cuba sus manifestaciones más floridas en las preces antifonarias de
                las liturgias, así de blancos como de negros, en la controversia erótica y danzarina
                de la rumba, y en los contrapunteos versificados de la guajirada montuna y de la
                currería afrocubana” (Let us remember the elaborate manifestations [of counterpoint]
                in Cuba, in the antiphonal liturgies of Blacks and whites, in the controversial
                erotics of the movement of the rumba, and in the versified counterpoints of country
                and Afro-Cuban peoples) (18).</p>
                
            <p>In his novel about the Haitian Revolution, <hi rend="italic">El siglo de las
                    luces</hi> (1962), Carpentier develops the aesthetics of the “arbitrario
                contrapunto de vidas” (the arbitrary counterpoint of lives) by considering the
                different, yet simultaneous, unfolding destinies of his protagonists, which shape
                and impact individual spheres of action as well as the grand récit of history (47).
                Carpentier later extends this idea in “Lo barroco y lo real maravilloso,” his essay
                about the marvelous real, where he again returns to the Haitian Revolution, Henri
                Christophe’s opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte, and François Mackandal, “que hace
                creer a millares y millares de esclavos en Haití . . . que puede transformarse en lo
                que quiera, y promueve con ellos una de las primeras revoluciones auténticas del
                Nuevo Mundo” (who convinces thousands and thousands of slaves in Haiti . . . that he
                can turn into anything, and promotes with them one of the first authentic
                revolutions of the New World) (84).</p>
                
            <p>Gikandi further develops the contrapuntal method when he applies it to reading the
                archive of Atlantic slavery and antislavery in <hi rend="italic">Slavery and the
                    Culture of Taste</hi> (2011) (xiii). He synchronizes the spatial, temporal,
                and interior dimensions of the lives of subjects as apparently disconnected as
                diarist Anna Larpent and Nealee, the enslaved woman in Mungo Park’s narrative. In
                other chapters, he considers texts by Francis Williams, David Hume, and Olaudah
                Equiano, and by Phillis Wheatley Peters, William Beckford, and Thomas Jefferson
                (among others) in contrapuntal relationship to each other. Gikandi accounts for how
                “the criteria driving the aesthetic ideology in the eighteenth century—disinterest
                and virtue, among others—had come to be haunted by slavery” (144). The effect of
                this more deliberate counterpoint, he observes, is to ensure “a dialectic between
                the visible subjects of modernity and its invisible actors” (70). Exegesis as an act
                of resistance exposes the symbolic systems that mediate materiality, disturbing the
                cognitive and symbolic separations between the violent system of the plantation,
                secured through empire, and the well-wrought tea set of the drawing room. Thus, it
                holds actors accountable for their complicity with such violence.</p>
                
            <p>The oral call-and-response underlying contrapuntal reading moreover gestures to this
                collection’s origins in a roundtable conversation on “Anti-Slavery Literature, Its
                Legacies, and the Future of Teaching,” organized in 2018 by members of the Five
                College Faculty Seminar on Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The Global
                            Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century seminar was founded in 2012 by
                            Joselyn M. Almeida (then UMass Amherst), Gülru Çakmak (University of
                            Massachusetts Amherst) and Kate Singer (Mount Holyoke College). Daniel
                            Block (then Hampshire College), later became a co-organizer. By 2018 it was
                            being led by Almeida, Singer, Lily Gurton-Wachter (Smith College), and
                            Amelia Worsley (Amherst College). The seminar was conceived as a venue
                            in which faculty from five colleges in the Amherst area of western
                            Massachusetts could collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of
                            scholars attentive to the intersections and tensions among the
                            constellations of globalization, cosmopolitanism, migration, and border
                            studies in the nineteenth century. Over the years, faculty from the Five
                            Colleges have met to share their work in progress and have also hosted
                            lectures from colleagues from the surrounding area, which have
                            illuminated the multiple intersections and tensions of colonialism and
                            globalization, Atlantic slavery, cosmopolitanism, migration, border
                            studies, and the digital humanities. Our conversation at the panel in
                            2018 was shaped by seminars with Simon Gikandi, Manu Samriti Chander,
                            Grégory Pierrot, Laura Doyle, Ron Welburn, Roberto Márquez, Orrin Wang,
                            Joel Pace, Elizabeth Maddock Dillon, and Jared Hickman. Because of
                            funding limitations, our invitations were restricted to colleagues
                            located on the East Coast of the United States, or those traveling
                            through the area. The 2018 pedagogy roundtable, held at Mount Holyoke
                                College, built on these shared experiences
                            and emerged from the community that these previous discussions had
                            created. </note> At that moment in time, many of us had been
                negotiating classroom conversations to which students brought issues raised by the
                Black Lives Matter movement. In dialogue with Kate Singer and Lily Gurton-Wachter,
                co-organizers of the seminar, we resolved to bring together four scholars of race
                and literature—Frances Botkin, Kimberly Juanita Brown, Sean Gordon, and Patricia A.
                Matthew—to create a safe and respectful space in which faculty and graduate student
                instructors could engage in dialogue with each other about how they were currently
                teaching antislavery texts from the Romantic period and how we might imagine
                teaching them in the future. Two of our speakers were local, and two traveled from
                different East Coast locations to be with us. The roundtable was transatlantic in
                disciplinary scope, with scholars representing Caribbean, American, and British
                literatures. In our invitation, we simply asked our colleagues to speak about
                approaches to teaching eighteenth- or nineteenth-century antislavery literature in
                the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. We asked them to share some moments
                from their own recent experiences in the classroom as well as their subsequent
                reflections on them. We stressed that the emphasis would be on conversation with the
                audience, whom we imagined would also find it useful to have a space to share their
                thoughts on classroom experience.</p>
                
            <p>An unusually large audience was in attendance at the pedagogy panel in the spring of
                2018; it was clear that this subject was of interest to students at both the
                graduate and undergraduate level, as well as to faculty members who more usually
                made up the audience of the Global Cultures of the Long Nineteenth Century
                    seminar. Several different pedagogical
                approaches were offered, but the panelists all shared a desire to confront the
                violence contained in these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts and the
                silences of the past and to share epistemologies of social justice, speaking to the
                present with the future in mind. Though the speakers approached the task of teaching
                different antislavery texts with different methodologies, each of them gave us an
                insight into classrooms where students are frequently invited to think about how to
                connect the past with the present moment. As our panelists discussed a range of
                approaches to teaching antislavery texts, the question of affect was clearly a
                central concern, as it had been in the discussion that led to the event. Students
                often have questions about the violence that these texts present them with, and, in
                turn, professors and instructors participating in the event had many questions for
                each other about how to frame that act of presentation. How should one prepare
                students for the affective responses—the emotions and feelings—that such triggering
                material is bound to bring into the room? How might we make space for conversation
                in the classroom about the various ways students might encounter antislavery
                literatures because of the varied experiences they bring to these texts? How do we
                support students through challenging readings beyond giving content warnings or
                making the readings optional?</p>
                
            <p>Several important questions about what it means to teach antislavery literature in
                the context of courses on Romanticism also emerged that day. As Saidiya Hartman asks
                in her 2008 essay “Venus in Two Acts,” where the archive is lacking, how can we
                retrieve “what remains dormant . . . without committing further acts of violence” in
                our own acts of narration (2)? Kimberly Juanita Brown played music over her own
                speech as she discussed the power of African American spirituals to invite students
                to connect to the “auditory dimensions” of the archive, a concept she also explores
                in her book
                <hi rend="italic">The Repeating Body: Slavery’s Visual Resonance in the Contemporary </hi>(2015)
                (140). Indeed, many of our panelists asked us to attune their ears to detect
                multilayered channels of communication in antislavery texts. A central theme in our
                discussion was the question of how to bring to light the things that the texts do
                not say about the realities of slavery in the period, either because of the blind
                spots of the authors or because of the constraints placed upon them.</p>
                
            <p>The essays that follow record various answers to these collective questions, and
                although they arose out of in-person conversations we had in a particular time and
                place, we hope they will continue to have relevance to a wider audience in the
                present moment. Three of the original speakers at the panel (Frances Botkin, Sean
                Gordon, and Patricia A. Matthew) have contributed essays. Although Kimberly Juanita
                Brown was not able to engage in this iteration of the conversation, the impact of
                her contributions to the panel nonetheless remains. We have also purposely included
                essays by participants who were at different stages in their university careers at
                the time of the event: Sean Gordon was a graduate student at the University of
                Massachusetts Amherst at the time of his original contribution to the panel, and he
                is now a professor at Fresno State University. Nick Blaisdell, now Ed.D., was an
                undergraduate when he attended our seminar. By inviting other participants to join
                the conversation about pedagogy via the medium of print, we gesture toward the
                shared frame of reference that the Global Cultures seminar had produced when we met
                in person. Ivan Ortiz and Elizabeth Fay, who had also spoken in our series,
                graciously accepted our invitation. We are also grateful to Debbie Lee and Alan
                Richardson for agreeing to offer responses to the essays. Two decades after they
                worked together on
                <hi rend="italic">Early Black British Writing </hi>(2004), Lee
                and Richardson offer a retrospective view not only of the shared insights of this
                collection but also of the changes that have occurred in the field since their
                groundbreaking critical anthology appeared.</p>

            <p>It has been intriguing for us to see that our contributors arrived at a shared
                methodology regarding how to approach teaching antislavery literatures today
                organically without a prompt from us and without reading drafts of one another’s
                essays. Each of them reframes and resituates eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                texts in new constellations, not only in relation to each other and to art and
                aesthetics from the period, but also in relation to texts from Black studies and to
                twentieth- and twenty-first-century works of fiction and criticism that
                seek to address the silences of the past. By asking students to
                listen to what remains unsaid in the texts they examine, several authors implicitly
                convey their commitments to contrapuntal reading.</p>
                
            <p>Patricia A. Matthew draws attention to how her students themselves implicitly enacted
                a contrapuntal method when they responded to the suppressed context of William
                Blake’s poem “The Little Black Boy.” Her essay presents a retrospective account of
                how this moment offered an invitation to continue to explore, in several different
                settings (both undergraduate and graduate), the effects of centering the topic of
                race and slavery in the classroom. Matthew invites makers of syllabi to look beyond
                the question of which single texts to use in a self-contained “unit” of a syllabus
                on slavery and instead to imagine how Romanticism looks when one centers race,
                abolition, and freedom on the level of the syllabus as a whole. She criticizes the
                idea that one can just add a single text about slavery to a syllabus and expect that
                the topic has been covered, as if a Romantic literature syllabus is a familiar
                recipe to which one can simply add a new ingredient. Rather than focusing a
                discussion about Atlantic slavery on a single text in a syllabus, Matthew argues, it
                should be considered a relevant context in discussions of all Romantic texts, even
                in texts where it seems not to be present. Matthew describes two different courses
                that center antislavery literatures and texts about race, including detailed
                discussions of teaching Blake’s poem, Hannah More and Eaglesfield Smith’s “The
                Sorrows of Yamba,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament; or, How to Make Sugar,”
                Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s 1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,” and the anonymous novel
                    <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</hi> (1808).</p>
                
            <p>Ivan Ortiz’s method can also be called contrapuntal from several perspectives. Ortiz
                puts Said’s argument about the silences in Austen’s <hi rend="italic">Mansfield
                    Park</hi> in dialogue with Lynn Festa’s argument that Austen is also asking
                readers to listen for “noise.” Ortiz begins by explaining how he uses this principle
                of “listening for noise” as a method to teach abolition poetry written by white
                authors. He positions this poetry in counterpoint with music when he asks students
                to examine the complexity of a situation in which both More’s version of “The
                Sorrows of Yamba” and William Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” were sung to the
                well-known ballad “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” a tune about white English sailors who
                had died at sea. He then turns to a text that could itself be called contrapuntal,
                M. NourbeSe Philip’s <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> (2008), which is “composed
                entirely from the words of the case report <hi rend="italic">Gregson vs.
                    Gilbert,</hi> related to the murder of Africans on board a slave ship at the end
                of the eighteenth century. <note place="foot" resp="author"> Description taken from <ref
                                target="http://www.nourbese.com/poetry/zong-3"
                                >www.nourbese.com/poetry/zong-3</ref>.</note> As students
                center their attention on the silences that this text exposes, Ortiz writes, they
                are confronted with the question of “what the fragmentation of language accomplishes
                that a ballad narrative cannot.”</p>
                
            <p>Sean Gordon extends the contrapuntal method beyond the frame of synchronicity to ask
                how twentieth-century narratives might also inform students’ understandings of
                nineteenth-century testimonies. He describes the project of “teaching contemporary
                texts that take up Romantic-era concepts in a ‘speculative’ framework,” like Celu
                Amberstone’s “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s
                <hi rend="italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </hi>(1995), and
                Samuel Delany’s <hi rend="italic">Empire Star </hi>(1966), in
                relation to
                <hi rend="italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano </hi>(1789).
                To frame his discussion of what it meant to discuss these texts on a campus
                responding to a series of violently racist incidents in 2014, Gordon centers Fred
                Moten’s term “dehiscence,” which describes a form of structural vulnerability that
                allows for productive disordering, as well as the Afropessimism of Frank Wilderson,
                pointing toward another speculative future, one in which a conversation between
                scholars of Black studies and scholars of Romanticism will become more common. He
                also discusses how teaching Mat Johnson’s novel
                <hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>(2011) in dialogue with Edgar Allan
                Poe’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi> (1838) allowed students
                to think through the issue of how structures of white privilege are implicit not
                only in the archive but also in the university itself.</p>
                
            <p>Afrofuturism provides a site of conceptual resistance in several of the essays here.
                As Terence Dean and Dale P. Andrews explain, “Afrofuturism is an evolving field of
                study in Black cultural studies. Its theories and scholarship are heavily influenced
                with particularities in science fiction, speculative fiction, new media, digital
                technology, the arts, and Black aesthetics all situated and focused on the continent
                of Africa, the Diaspora, and its imaginaries” (2). Through her syllabus and
                classroom discussion, Elizabeth Fay stages an innovative conversation between
                Afrofuturism, Romanticism, and Atlantic studies and challenges students to
                reinterpret Atlantic history by juxtaposing past and present narratives of the
                legacies of enslavement. When Fay asks students to compare Olaudah Equiano’s
                narrative with the film
                <hi rend="italic">Black Panther </hi>(2018) and contextualizes
                this question in relation to N. K. Jemisin’s introduction to Afrofuturism in her
                essay “How Long ’til Black Future Month?,” she extends the possibilities for the
                interpretation of “geographical space, conceptual space, and textual space” in Black
                Atlantic narratives (Dillon 31).</p>
                
            <p>In the broader sweep of her essay, Fay emphasizes “the fluid movement of dynamic
                relationality among multiple and variable subjects” as she explores various
                exercises designed to ask students to triangulate narratives of enslavement and
                post-enslavement. For instance, Fay invites students to consider how Mary Prince’s
                nineteenth-century rhetorics of suffering and resistance compare with those of
                Equiano, and then she further complicates the question by asking them to read the
                rhetoric of Toussaint L’Ouverture’s letters in relation to C. L. R. James’s account
                of his life in <hi rend="italic">The Black Jacobins</hi> (1938). Sylvia Wynter’s
                article on James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,” also offers
                students an argument about how James’s work helps to posit a theory of “becoming
                Black” that, in Fay’s words, is relevant “whether the year is 1800 or 2024.” In
                another unit of the syllabus, Fay triangulates Lenora Sansay’s
                <hi rend="italic">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo </hi>(1808)
                and the anonymous
                <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </hi>with
                Austen’s <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, as she asks students to compare
                fictionalized accounts of women’s experiences in the period, and she further
                contextualizes this exercise with references to the work of Christina Sharpe and
                Wynter.</p>
                
            <p>Frances Botkin also offers many possibilities for students to read contrapuntally
                when she insists that Romantic-era narratives cannot be taught without a serious
                commitment to contextualization. Through a theorization of the practice of <hi
                    rend="italic">tunyuhan</hi> (“to make the best use of available resources to
                create something new and sustainable”), Botkin uses what she terms an “undisciplined
                mode of assembly” to consider the value of generative improvisation in teaching, and
                she explores how contemporary art, film, music, and recordings of interviews with
                people in Jamaica “animate colonial textuality with the creative expressions of
                Afro-Caribbean culture that, in revising the past, imagines and nourishes future
                worlds.” She describes, for instance, how she presents students with Lydia Maria
                Child’s
                <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam </hi>(1834)
                (extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Five Years
                    Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> [1796]), alongside John
                Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</hi> (1800), a
                painting of Three-Fingered Jack by the Jamaican painter Omari “Afrikan” Ra, and a
                documentary film by Roy Anderson called
                <hi rend="italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </hi>(2015).
                This constellation of works allows students to see how “Child almost entirely
                excludes the Maroons with whom Joanna had family connections.” When she asks
                students to read Mary Prince’s
                <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave </hi>(1831)
                alongside Marlon James’s <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> (2009), she
                puts further pressure on the question of what nineteenth-century writers do not say
                about the experiences of enslaved people and particularly of enslaved women.</p>
                
            <p>Another way in which the dialogic space can be transformed to create an antiracist
                classroom is through the acknowledgment of the tension between writing and speech,
                foregrounding for students the incomplete nature of the antislavery archive. In her
                focus on “doing the work” of traveling to Jamaica in order to better understand
                Maroon history, Botkin centers the notion of orality in order to problematize the
                hierarchy of knowledge that privileges the archive. Her fieldwork and connection to
                the Maroon leader Gaama Gloria Simms has enabled her to create a contact zone in the
                classroom where the oral histories of Afro-Caribbean descendants of Maroon
                communities expose asymmetries of power and the injustices encoded as silence in the
                written record. The annual conference in Jamaica that she co-organizes with Paul
                Youngquist, the Charles Town International Conference on Maroons and Indigenous
                People, reconfigures the spaces and possibilities of knowledge for Romanticists,
                which brings the “archive” into conversation with living indigenous knowledge.</p>
                
            <p>Nicholas Blaisdell elucidates how counterpoint as exegesis awakens agency, as
                Carpentier also discovered in <hi rend="italic">El siglo de las luces</hi>, when
                Sofía, one of his protagonists, urges, “¡Hay que hacer algo!” (Something must be
                done!) (410). Blaisdell explores how antislavery writers like Ottobah Cugoano indict
                capitalism’s use of enslaved labor in the nineteenth century as a global system,
                anticipating the system’s accommodation of unfree labor through the present era.
                Drawing on Paulo Freire, he reflects on how the study of antislavery texts,
                abolitionist networks, and Karl Marx informed not only his development as a social
                justice activist and organizer of Black Lives Matter protests in Peabody,
                Massachusetts, but also his work as a high school teacher and an adjunct professor
                of education. His analysis illuminates how a Freirean pedagogy can translate into
                greater empowerment for students in educational and civic settings.</p>

            <head>II. Beyond the Anthology</head>
                
            <p>A brief review of the texts available for teaching the topic of antislavery
                literature, as well as the history of its anthologizing, may be useful to those
                planning to embark on teaching it for the first time, as well as to those wishing to
                think further about the relationship between how developments in research relate to
                those in their own pedagogy. Indeed, the current moment necessitates a commitment to
                the continued and critical self-examination of genealogies of antislavery
                literature. Scholars have long been engaged in the struggle to bring this material
                into classrooms. Thus, for example, Eva B. Dykes, whose work, as Bakary Diaby has
                pointed out, should be reassessed, was the earliest critic to call for an expansion
                of the Romantic canon to include antislavery writings (Diaby, “Black Women”).
                Dykes’s groundbreaking
                <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought; or, A Study of Sympathy for the Oppressed </hi>(1942),
                written in the twilight of the Harlem Renaissance and also at the height of Jim Crow
                segregation in the United States, drew attention to names such as Olaudah Equiano,
                Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, and Mary Prince, writers not yet present in any
                anthologies of Romantic-era literature at the time. The reassessment of Dykes’s work
                seems particularly necessary when one notes that a forty-year silence passed between
                the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</hi> in
                1942 and 1985, when Charles T. Davis and Henry Louis Gates Jr. published their
                pivotal anthology
                <hi rend="italic">The Slave’s Narrative </hi>(1985), which
                presented excerpts by Equiano, Cugoano, Sancho, and James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw,
                among others.</p>
                
            <p>It was not until the 1990s that access to antislavery literature became more
                widespread. Inspired by both the historicist and postcolonial turns in Romantic-era
                scholarship, scholars in the United States and Britain worked to incorporate Black
                Atlantic authors into the Anglo-American canon throughout this period.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In Romantic

                first created in the 1990s, made information on Equiano, Sancho, and antislavery
                poems available on the web. Anne K. Mellor and Richard Matlak were the first editors
                of a broader anthology to grant a section to “Slavery, the Slave Trade, and
                Abolition in Britain” when they included it in their <hi rend="italic">British

            <p>The scholarly recovery of Romanticism’s implication in antislavery and the struggle
                for abolition was also enormously facilitated by the publication of Peter J. Kitson
                and Debbie Lee’s eight-volume <hi rend="italic">Slavery, Abolition and Emancipation:
                    Writings in the British Romantic Period</hi> (1999). Following from this,
                collections such as James G. Basker’s <hi rend="italic">Amazing Grace: An Anthology
                    of Poems about Slavery, 1660–1810</hi> (2002), Marcus Wood’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Poetry of Slavery: An Anglo-American Anthology, 1764–1866 </hi>(2003),
                    <hi rend="italic">Early Black British Writing</hi> (2004), edited by Alan

                (2006), edited by Lance Newman, Joel Pace, and Chris Koenig-Woodward, also made
                antislavery texts more accessible than they had previously been. The republication
                of various novels that pertain to this topic has similarly changed students’
                classroom experiences. For instance, many of our colleagues now use the Broadview
                Press edition of the anonymous <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale</hi>
                (2008), edited by Lyndon J. Dominique. Since it is not possible to anthologize
                novels in the same way as other texts, A. A. Markley’s overview of lesser-taught
                novels and plays is a useful resource for those wishing to teach novels that deal
                with the topic of slavery.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For instance,
                        Markley suggests that Anna Maria Mackenzie’s <hi rend="italic">Slavery; or,

                aesthetics of the period has also led to an increased access to primary texts for
                use in the classroom. We note, for example, the publication of Marcus Rainsford’s

                of the scholarly literature in this period, we note that our respondents, Debbie Lee
                and Alan Richardson, not only played key scholarly roles in producing anthologies of
                these literatures but also helped to define the critical
                conversation. Richardson’s
                seminal 1993 article “Romantic Voodoo: Obeah and British Culture, 1797–1807” opened the field to Afro-British intertexts in the
                archive, those within textuality and beyond. Lee’s <hi rend="italic">Slavery and the
                    Romantic Imagination</hi> (2002) is a fundamental text in any survey of this
                corpus.</p>
                
            <p>Having said all of this, it is important to acknowledge that course syllabi have been
                in many cases slow to change—both during the 1990s and today. Zadie Smith and
                Paterson Joseph have each described the way that their education in the United
                Kingdom failed to take account of Black history. In a September 2022 article in
                <hi rend="italic">The Guardian </hi>written in connection with
                her foreword to a new edition of Gretchen Gerzina’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Black England: A Forgotten Georgian History </hi>(2022), Smith remembers the effect that finding Gerzina’s book had
                on her. She writes, “It’s incredible to think of now, but by 1999 I’d gone through
                15 years of formal education, including a three-year English degree, without ever
                being given a book to study that made any reference whatsoever to the presence of
                individuals like me in the country in which I was born.” Joseph has also described
                his encounter with Gerzina’s book as a life-changing one (Sulcis).</p>
                
            <p>The “Bigger Six Collective” was formed in 2017 to resist the narrative that
                “diversification” or “going global” has done enough to change the field; instead,
                they have called for the need “to make our field in the image of those whose access
                to Romanticism has long been and continues to be actively restricted” (140).<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the
                            collective’s origins and aims, see <ref
                                target="https://www.bigger6.com/"
                            >https://www.bigger6.com/</ref>.</note> More recently, Deanna
                Koretsky has offered a searing indictment of the field’s continuing intransigence:
                “Scholars of romanticism in its current configuration are all white men, which is to
                say, we work in a field that was not only built around white bodies and sustained
                through white critical perspectives but that has explicitly and deliberately been
                used to maintain fictions of whiteness as transparent and thus universal” (31).
                Moreover, many critiques of Romanticism remain firmly within the Anglo-American
                academy, precluding methodologies that reveal alternative positionalities and
                epistemes. Antislavery literatures—even aside from the larger and more neglected
                topic of race and Romanticism—still occupy a marginal position in the undergraduate
                curriculum.</p>
                
            <p>Despite the efforts of many scholars to join in the work of recovery and to redress
                the biases of twentieth-century criticism and editing of Romantic texts, the topic
                of slavery and abolition is still frequently framed as an addition to the
                anthologies that undergraduate classes rely on and in syllabi themselves. Digital
                searches of databases of online syllabi suggest that a handful of texts, especially
                in surveys of the period, are being asked to carry a heavy freight. Many and varied
                obstacles have been put in the way of affirming the contributions of Black and Brown
                writers from the period in the classroom. The presence of Mary Seacole and Ukawsaw
                Gronniosaw in anthologies of Black British writers, for instance, does not guarantee
                them a place on syllabi. Additionally, neither African American writers, such as
                Jupiter Hammon and John Marrant, nor Plácido and Juan Manzano, from the Hispanophone
                Atlantic, appear often on syllabi. In “Abolitionist Interruptions,” Chander and
                Matthew note their “shared frustration with how Olaudah Equiano and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> have served too long as the single
                abolitionist/antislavery text in Romanticism” (431), a discussion that Matthew
                extends in her essay for the present volume. The tradition that has elided subjects
                who historically were denied ontological value and who were silenced through
                enslavement and racism in the economic and geopolitical system of Atlantic slavery
                can still be observed today in this disconnect between research and pedagogy.</p>

            <p>The project of articulating linkages that connect the teaching praxis of Romanticists
                with histories of resistance, liberation, struggles against slavery and for the rights of the oppressed, goes far beyond the purview of a single volume, and
                so we wish to note some of the areas for pedagogical inquiry within which our
                contributors have opened vistas. We hope that the pedagogical experiments detailed
                in this collection will be useful in practical terms for instructors as a guide to
                how to begin redesigning their own syllabi and classroom discussions. The larger
                aim, however, is for the collection to be useful in broader methodological terms as
                a prompt for readers to imagine their own contrapuntal arrangements of texts and
                voices. The possibilities for new contrapuntal readings and new constellations of
                texts go far beyond the specific texts or arrangements listed in these case
                studies.</p>
                
            <p>Beyond simply adding texts to established syllabi, then, our contributors imagine how
                to disrupt pedagogical traditions that have been handed down from past generations
                of scholars. These scholars invite readers to examine the degree to which their own
                pedagogy reflects transformations in the field, even as they push for further
                re-examination of the structures on which pedagogical attitudes to teaching
                antislavery have previously been built. Our contributors tend to agree that because
                Romantic-era accounts of slavery were conditioned by the period in which they were
                written, it is “not enough,” as Frances Botkin puts it, to ask them to speak on
                behalf of the enslaved without other sources to contextualize them. Dykes poignantly
                draws attention to this paradox at the center of Romantic antislavery literature in
                the opening pages of <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</hi>.
                “One of the salient features of the ‘Romantic Movement’ of the latter eighteenth and
                early nineteenth centuries was the love of freedom” (1), she writes, paying tribute
                to Mary Prince’s famous line, “To be free is very sweet” (27). However, she then
                immediately notes that Romantic writers could also be “limited . . . by an adherence
                to traditional forms and conventions,” and notes that antislavery writings did not
                always depose the hierarchical structure and racism that authorized the triangular
                trade in the first place (1). Many scholars since Dykes have complicated any simple
                celebration of the expansion of the Romantic canon to include antislavery texts by
                exploring the capacity of these texts to sometimes “popularize stereotyped,
                simplified, patronizing, and (often) degrading images of Africa, its peoples, and
                their descendants in the Americas and Britain” despite their ethical and civic
                commitments to breaking the Blakean “mind forg’d manacles” that sustained Atlantic
                slavery (Richardson and Lee 7). The contributors to this collection build on their
                project.</p>
                
            <p>Many of our contributors use specific examples to describe a method that could be
                applied to various texts. The example Matthew gives, for instance, of what it means
                to read William Blake’s work in dialogue with antislavery literatures encourages
                pedagogues to look more closely at how canonical texts they have taught without
                reference to the history of slavery might change when this crucial and yet often
                sidelined context is brought to bear on them. Similarly, Gordon’s and Fay’s
                references to Afrofuturist texts invite readers to conduct their own research in
                this field and to imagine their own conversations between the past and speculative
                futures. Another question that emerges from this focus on Afrofuturism is whether
                there might be room for more opportunities for students to encounter examples of
                Black resistance, humor, joy, and agency in the Romantic classroom. New
                possibilities for dialogue with contemporary texts will continue to arise as new
                works of critical fabulation appear. Since we first began to gather this collection,
                for instance, many of our colleagues have begun to teach texts such as Honorée
                Fanonne Jeffers’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Age of Phillis </hi>(2020) and Joseph’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Secret Diaries of Charles Ignatius Sancho </hi>(2022),
                alongside Wheatley Peters’s poetry and Sancho’s letters.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In the British Museum event “An
                            Era of Reclamation | Beyond Bridgerton,” also recorded online,
                            participants questioned the effects of the erasure of the history of
                            slavery. See <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_fqH2t0x1U0"

            <p>Our work on this set of essays has prompted us to imagine several future topics for
                <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles </hi>collections on how to
                engage antislavery literatures in the classroom, for which we would be pleased to
                see responses. While our contributors engage the question of affect in passing, for
                instance, our field would benefit from a more sustained conversation about how to
                acknowledge the range of emotions that the learning process might bring up in
                classes that consider the history of slavery. Critical work that addresses the
                personal experience of critics themselves can offer crucial models for students: we
                eagerly await the publication of Mathelinda Nabugodi’s <hi rend="italic">The
                    Trembling Hand: Reflections of a Black Woman in the Romantic Archive,</hi> for
                instance. From another perspective, both Botkin and Ortiz encourage attention to the
                aural dimension of textuality and its silences, which reveals how orality and the
                epistemologies it transmits are also major components of the antislavery archive
                that could be engaged further. Becoming aware of the limitations that govern the
                textual archive<hi rend="italic"> as text,</hi> with attention
                to the conditions of its production, will allow for the interrogation of approaches
                with which Romanticists are familiar, such as historicist, post-structuralist,
                feminist, postcolonial, and neo-formalist methodologies.</p>
                
            <p>The essays here also enjoin readers to consider important questions that remain on
                the horizon of this collection about the extent to which discussions of antislavery
                texts have been made to stand in for larger discussions about race in the Romantic
                period and how this tendency might be addressed in the future. This connects the
                work of the collection with Marlon B. Ross’s call to “shift the focus momentarily
                away from the important question of Romanticism’s self-conscious investment in or
                diversion from slavery and colonialism to consider <hi rend="italic">race</hi>
                itself as an economy of gut-instinctual, senseperceptual, socialpsychological,
                aesthetic-ideological, and geopolitical commitments,” in his essay “The Race of/in
                Romanticism: Notes Toward a Critical Race Theory” (26). As Diaby argues, “we must
                continue working on slavery, but we should not let it be our only engagement with,
                again, the deeply quotidian, socio-personal ordering of the world we inhabit and
                have inherited from the long Romantic period” (“Black Women” 252). Diaby himself
                offers a rare example of what it means to bring the topic of race to bear on texts
                that have not traditionally been grouped under the heading of those that address the
                topic of race in the Romantic period in his reading of William Wordsworth’s “We Are
                Seven” (“Counting the Bodies”). Although several of our authors encourage a more
                open dialogue between Black studies and Romanticism, a more widespread and sustained
                dialogue between Romantic literature and critical race theory is clearly necessary
                in the field at large.</p>
                
            <p>The field of Romanticism, and especially the study of slavery in the Romantic period,
                still needs to do more to address the divisions it has historically instantiated
                between Anglophone texts and texts in other languages. The Anglophone focus of the
                authors examined throughout this collection points to multilingualism and
                Romanticism as a related area for future research as the plurilingual nature of the
                histories of African and indigenous resistance comes further into view. As Gillian
                Sankoff writes, “It is difficult to conceive of another situation where people
                arrived with such a variety of native languages, where they were so cut off from
                their native language groups; where the size of no language group was enough to
                ensure its survival; where no second language was shared by enough people to serve
                as a useful vehicle of intercommunication; and where the legitimate language was
                inaccessible to almost everyone” (24).</p>
                
            <p>For some of the writers in the archive of antislavery literatures, the process of
                translation into English and language acquisition was also a process of living
                through epistemic violence. Yet the governing assumption in Romantic-era studies in
                approaching the antislavery archive is that the language of Black British authors is
                English (Almeida 114). A similar assumption governs the indigenous archive, as Hessell
                shows in
                <hi rend="italic">Romantic Literature and the Colonised World: Lessons from Indigenous Translations </hi>(2018).
                Hessell argues that indigenous interpretations of canonical authors are more than
                “novelties, nor [are they] simple evidence of the global power and reach of Romantic
                literature” (228) but are “simultaneous expressions of the value of Romantic
                literature and of the experience of colonization” (230).</p>
                
            <p>While some might respond that the study of British or American literature is
                Anglocentric by nature, this commitment to monolingualism out of habit robs the
                field of depth and breadth, since the African diaspora was not limited to
                English-speaking countries. During and even after the abolition of slavery in 1833,
                Britain continued to trade with the Global South while at the same time making
                greater imperial incursions in Africa and India, as scholars such as Robin
                Blackburn, Rebecca Cole Heinowitz, Omar Miranda, César Soto, Juan Sánchez, Jesse
                Reeder, and Sara Medina Calzada have shown. Even so, texts from this “second
                slavery,” as Dale Tomich has called it, have a belated entrance into Romanticism.
                Such texts include, for example, Juan Manzano’s <hi rend="italic">The Life and Poems
                    of a Cuban Slave</hi> (1840), translated by the abolitionist Richard Robert
                Madden, who also testified in the <hi rend="italic">Amistad</hi> trial, which
                vindicated the rights of enslaved persons to rise up against their enslavers and was
                one of the most famous international trials of its time. Nicole Aljoe suggests that
                the 1848 biography of the enslaved Brazilian Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua is another
                useful starting point for those wishing to expand their students’ reference points
                beyond texts written in English (<hi rend="italic">Creole Testimonies</hi> 111).
                Aljoe also challenges “the marginal status of West Indian slave narratives within
                critical discourses of the slave narrative genre, Caribbean and Black Atlantic
                literary histories” and reveals how abolitionist groups in England, the United
                States, and the West Indies were in close contact with one another (<hi
                    rend="italic">Creole Testimonies</hi> 2).</p>
                
            <p>Moreover, monolingualism, when assumed as a “natural state,” prevents a true
                reckoning with how English functioned as a significant barrier for the millions of
                people in British colonies who were deprived of access not only to literacy but also
                to the judicial recognition of their oral testimony in colonial courts, further
                limiting access to “the legitimate language.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In 1828, the law was revised to allow “the admission of
                        the evidence of slaves, in those cases only in which they are the actors or
                        the sufferers, excluding their evidence in other cases” (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Slave Law of Jamaica</hi> 216; see also 134–7.)</note> English in
                its oral and written forms was therefore a second language for many formerly
                enslaved authors, from Wheatley Peters to Sancho and Cugoano. Acknowledging and
                considering this duality helps to decenter the assumption of the normativity of
                English and the nationalist and imperialist subtexts underpinning the idea that it
                is the language of Romanticism. Doing so disentangles it from the “metaphysical
                empires” of language that Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o denounces and that his son, critic
                Mukoma Wa Ngugi, terms “EME” as shorthand for “English Metaphysical Empire” (Wa
                Ngugi; Mignolo). As much as they are part of the standardization of languages in
                this period, the creolizations of English and other European languages in contact
                zones are also part of the Romantic aesthetic (Elfenbein). In the United States, the
                question of accessibility is compounded by the disciplinary gateway of English as
                the privileged language of the corpus, since millions of its citizens speak
                languages other than English that go unrecognized if Romanticism is configured as
                solely Anglocentric. As we reimagine community in the twenty-first century to create
                spaces of redress and also of transformation, Romanticist scholars must do more to
                invite students to imagine new contact zones not only between canonical and
                non-canonical texts and between or among disciplines but also between the past and
                the present, between history and historical fiction, between printed and living
                voices, and between linguistic communities whose ties to each other have been
                willfully and violently erased.</p>

            <p>The genre of writing we asked contributors to engage in as their arguments took
                shape—something between argumentative prose, critical history, personal narrative,
                and a practical guide—is one that we are rarely asked to engage in as academics, and
                we thank the editors of
                <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles </hi>for the room they have
                made within the field for this kind of reflection.<note place="foot" resp="author">We wish to thank Kirstyn Leuner, Andrew Birkett, and Anna Wingfield at 
                    <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles</hi>; Mary Bellino, our copyeditor; and the departments of English at Amherst College and UMass 
                    Amherst for supporting the completion of this project.</note> Following the work of exemplary
                scholars and educators such as Paolo Freire, Stuart Hall, bell hooks, and Edward
                Said, we are humbled by the task of approaching, alongside our contributors, the
                question of how our teaching and scholarship can contribute to the advancement of
                restorative justice. We inhabit a global community where division and injustice
                toward those structurally submitted to exclusionary regimes is increasing due to
                economic agendas that put profit over people, wage geopolitical conflict around the
                globe, disregard climate change, and mismanage the fallout from Covid-19. As Hall
                sagely anticipated in his seminal 1980 essay, “Teaching Race”:
                
            <quote>The really crucial question is how do you begin to make that move away from the level
                of prejudice and belief? One needs to undermine the obvious. One has to show that
                these are social and historical processes and that they are not written in the
                stars, they are not handed down. They are deep conditions which are not going to
                change if we start tinkering around with them. We must not give our students that
                kind of illusion. We can however begin the process of questioning what the
                structures are and how they work. (127)</quote>
                
            This collection enters into the spirit of “beginning the process of questioning” with
                the awareness that there are many more questions to be asked than can be answered in
                one volume. Because it has emerged out of a call for colleagues within a particular
                geographically defined network to describe to us what they were already teaching,
                rather than from an open call for work about the future of our field at large, we
                cannot make claims for broad coverage. We regret that no essays address Romantic
                antislavery literatures from Latin America, Africa, Asia, or Australia, or work with
                indigenous literatures, translation, or multilingualism. We also regret that there
                is no essay that addresses in detail the question of how to teach the Haitian
                Revolution, which is clearly foundational in the study of antislavery in the
                Romantic period. As Nick Nessbit, drawing on Marx, writes in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean</hi> (2022)<hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> such work brings “living labor” to the forefront and its
                connection to Hegelian historical realization.<note

                            current moment, see Reed (2020).</note> As the discourse of
                antiracist approaches to teaching literature of the Romantic period continues to
                broaden, we hope this volume—a record of one localized conversation—will be a prompt
                to further discussion.</p>
                
            <p>The essays collected here explore how recent history informs the way students might
                currently receive Romantic texts, clearing a space for further discussion about how
                the conversation will continue to change the way Romantic texts signify. As scholars
                and teachers, becoming conscious of not only how pedagogical praxis might be shaped
                by developments in research and critical race theory but also how events in the
                classroom might reshape research is more than a matter of good teaching or meeting
                the publish-or-perish expectations of the academy. Taken together, these essays
                encourage scholars to reflect on how both instructors and students must consider the
                relation between the classroom and the university and its relationship to the
                imagined community at the national and planetary levels. As Matthew, Gordon,
                Richardson, and Lee elucidate here, instructors and students must grapple with how
                structures of white privilege are implicit in the university, the archive, and the
                discipline so that together they can transform interpretation into a dialogic act of
                resistance as they deconstruct racialist and exclusionary discourses, thereby
                creating alternative spaces of interrelational knowledge.</p>
                
            <p>The co-creation of knowledge is one of the paths toward the liberatory potential of
                education that Freire, a major inspiration for the 2018 panel, describes. Arguing
                against the “banking concept” of education, a system in which students merely bank
                information they passively receive from their teacher, Freire challenges the
                asymmetry of power central to the subject/object dichotomy that is also at the core
                of the ontological negation that racism relies on. As hooks writes in her meditation
                on how Freire’s pedagogy informs her own, “Freire’s work affirmed that education can
                only be liberatory when everyone claims knowledge as a field in which we all labor”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Teaching to Transgress</hi> 14). Moments of first encounter
                are often formative: students are coming to texts about slavery from a different
                historical perspective than their teachers, and this means that students have the
                potential to teach their instructors things that they have not before seen and that
                they may find hard to see.</p>
                
            <p>While by no means exhaustive, this conversation offers some specific practices in the
                attempt to create classroom environments to fashion a place “where both [professors
                and students] are simultaneously teachers and students” while respecting the
                intersectionalities of race, gender, and class in our increasingly diverse student
                body (Freire 72). hooks also cautions that “teachers are often among that group most
                reluctant to acknowledge the extent to which white-supremacist thinking informs
                every aspect of our culture including the way we learn, the content of what we
                learn, and the manner in which we are taught”
                (<hi rend="italic">Teaching Community </hi>25). With this in
                mind, the discussions here respectfully offer multiple ways to reflect on how we
                might more consciously acknowledge and evaluate how our own experiences inflect our
                pedagogical practices and how to work with students to create spaces in our
                classrooms for this vital dialogue. At a time when events in the United States have
                inspired civic action and debate in countries across the world, the present moment
                can no longer be kept outside the doors of a classroom in which Romantic literature
                is being read. As scholars, it is useful to consider not only how pedagogical praxis
                might be reshaped by developments in research but also how events in the classroom
                might reshape research practices.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p> This essay reflects on the process of revising Romanticism courses in response to student curiosity about how race, 
                primarily Blackness, operates in the period. It includes a discussion of how teaching texts by William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 
                Amelia Opie, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth reveals to students how the period connects race to issues of representation, authorship, 
                gender, and social contracts. Sparked by observing how students debate race and representation when it unexpectedly appears in their readings
                from the Romantic period, this essay makes two claims: (1) taking up race and representation in the Romanticism classroom is not simply about 
                including texts by people of color but is also about recontextualizing the period as a whole; and (2) cultivating student interest in Romantic-era 
                racial politics offers them a model for how to think about race, representation, and politics in the twenty-first century. </p>

            <p>My decision to design a class that focuses on Romantic-era abolitionist literature
                was sparked by a student debate about how to interpret William Blake’s “The Little
                Black Boy.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> I
                            am grateful to Amelia Worsley and Joselyn M. Almeida for their work on
                            this essay and to Manu Chander, Tina Iemma, and Deanna Koretsky for
                            reading recommendations.</note> It was in the spring of 2006,
                the semester before my tenure file was due and just a few years before the United
                States elected its first Black president. Students were reading the poem in my
                fairly traditional Romanticism survey course, one that focused on canonical poets
                (i.e., the “Big Six”) along with Mary Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>
                (1818) and <hi rend="italic">Valperga</hi> (1823). The course paid very little
                attention to critical discussions about how these same writers responded to debates
                about England’s participation in the transatlantic slave trade, and for the first
                three years that I taught Blake’s poem, no student had challenged the line that we
                ended up discussing for a full 75-minute class period: “And I am black, but O! my
                soul is white” (line 2). On a handout that included the poem and a few warm-up
                questions, a student circled the line and wrote: “WTF??!!?” next to it.</p>
               
            <p>A rambunctious debate that I wasn’t quite prepared to moderate followed. As a
                specialist in Regency- and Romantic-era fiction, I knew enough about Black figures
                in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature to help students understand the
                presence of Black people in Romantic-era England.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">On this topic see also Newman (2021),
                            Gerzina (1995), and Olusoga (2016).</note> I did not, however,
                know enough about the politics of race during the Romantic period to help my
                students think as carefully as I wanted them to about this line. Working through
                what my students needed to contextualize the line and sorting out how to cultivate
                the same analytical energy in response to their other readings contributed to this
                “abolitionist turn” in my teaching of Romanticism. In what follows I show how I made
                this transition in my undergraduate and graduate courses. I discuss critical essays
                that have been most useful for students and assignments that can potentially take
                the work of the class beyond the university classroom.</p>
               
            <p>Threaded through this reflection is an evaluation of how much of the success of these
                curricular revisions is because of how I responded to students’ unusually animated response
                to how race operates in the Romantic period. As I explain in my essay “Academic
                Freedom: Students and the Problem with Labels,” I expend a great deal of energy
                preserving class discussions as a space where students feel free to wrestle with
                complex ideas, free from expectations that they reflect a specific political point
                of view. I aim for what bell hooks calls “a central goal of transformative
                pedagogy”: making the classroom “a democratic setting where everyone feels a
                responsibility to contribute” (39). Teaching Romanticism with a focus on
                abolitionist culture has made this goal easier to reach. I have found that in
                learning about an abolitionist Romanticism, students are not only studying
                historical texts and their connection to a literary movement they had not recognized
                as infused with racialized imagery and philosophy but are also learning more about
                the intricacies of society, protest, and revolution.</p>
               
            <p>When I started this process, I faced two obstacles. First, my graduate training,
                which in 2006 was still the foundation for teaching Romanticism, did not bring
                questions of race or Blackness to bear on Romanticism. Additionally, as a new
                professor, I was anxious to teach Romantic poetry in a way that was legible to
                senior British-literature faculty, especially those who looked askance at my
                decision to include novels in a course they believed should focus only on poetry. I
                was also facing a short tenure clock and an institutional environment hostile to
                faculty of color, realities that left me little time to substantially revise the
                course I was hired to teach. As a result, my first instinct was simply to add more
                texts that explicitly included mentions of Black figures or referred to slavery or
                abolition. This, however, felt like a superficial response to a pedagogical project
                that required nuance not only in texts I might add to the syllabus but also how
                those additions would alter students’ understanding of the Romantic period as a
                whole. To put it simply, would it matter if I added Ottobah Cugoano without thinking
                about how to reframe “The Little Black Boy” or Blake and his contemporaries?</p>
               
            <p>In response to this set of concerns, my initial impulse was to read articles and book
                chapters that focus on how the writers already on the syllabus thought about the
                slave trade, abolition, amelioration, and emancipation. I also experimented in the
                undergraduate classes I regularly taught (“Introduction to Theory”; “Art of
                Fiction”; and “The Novel to 1900”) by introducing new primary texts. I started with
                just a few texts (primarily fiction) and then planned short units that included
                abolitionist literature reflecting the overall themes of the courses. A course on
                women in nineteenth-century literature, for example, included a unit on marriage and
                chattel slavery. I then offered a “special topics” course that explicitly focused on
                abolition and the nineteenth century. By 2014, when my department added a new
                required course, “Writing for the Major,” designed for new English majors, I had the
                materials to plan an entire course that focused on the writers included in my
                Romanticism syllabus and their contemporaries, in the context of debates about slavery, and this provided an opportunity for
                students to think about race, abolition, and freedom as essential to how we read
                literature, regardless of the time period from which it emerges. My goal was to
                bring this lens to the period not only for special courses but also as a matter of
                course.</p>

            <p>My student’s visceral response to “And I am black, but O! my soul is white” (or as I
                came to call it, the “WTF” line) was prompted by a few elements in the poem and gaps
                in their knowledge about its author. The poem begins, “My mother bore me in the
                Southern Wild” (line 1). Students reading poems written in the first-person voice
                often conflate the speaker in the poem with the poem’s author. It is also likely
                that they had not read the biographical information about Blake included in the
                anthology. This meant that they did not know who Blake was and whether or not the
                poem was directly about him. They also did not know if Blake was Black. What follows
                the “WTF” line shocked students who read it as an exceptionally explicit affirmation
                of white supremacy: “White as an angel is the English Child / But I am black as if
                bereaved of light” (lines 4–5). For some students, particularly students of color, a
                Black author writing these lines reflected a self-loathing. Those same students
                struggled with a white author comparing white children to angels while denigrating
                Black skin. Other students read the line as innocuous. They either did not see the
                problem of the racial hierarchy that the poem promoted or saw such beliefs as
                historical relics. These initial responses reflect the dominant racial mythologies
                that held sway in 2006. A diverse group of students in a class on British literature
                taught by a Black professor were prepared to think that racist ideas prevalent in
                the nineteenth century had been eradicated by the Civil Rights Movement.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I am fully
                            aware that some students were surprised because they had not completed
                            the reading for the day. This meant they encountered the poem for the
                            first time in class.</note> Students who assumed that the author of the
                poem was Black because of its title interpreted the statement as a sign of
                    self-loathing. They saw a Black speaker denigrating his skin color and valorizing whiteness as the
                ideal. Other students were willing to allow that attitudes about race in the
                Romantic period were less enlightened than they imagined them to be in the
                twenty-first century; however, they also understood that whatever informed
                nineteenth-century attitudes about race did not mitigate the troubling racial
                hierarchies the line signified. Barack Obama and the backlash to his candidacy had
                not entered their field of vision, and, unlike students who studied abolitionist
                literature with me in subsequent semesters, many of them had not yet been required
                to confront a world that included the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and
                to process what the protests in Ferguson, Missouri revealed. Donald Trump was not
                yet legible to them as a political threat. As I discuss below, Romanticism’s racism
                felt more contemporary near the end of Obama’s presidency, but in 2006 students
                turned to historical context and information about Blake and his contemporaries to
                interpret the line, and they wanted to understand whether or not the language in the poem signified to 
                eighteenth- and nineteenth-century readers what it meant to them in 2006.</p>
                   
            <p>Students also asked the same question about Blake that critics defensive of their
                chosen authors ask when questions of race and racism arise: If the line is racist,
                should we hold Blake responsible for ideas that were widely, uncritically
                circulating in the 1800s but unacceptable now? They were also, then, intensely
                curious to see how his contemporaries wrote about this—if Blake was in step, out of
                step, or prescient. When I explained that the poem was published at a particularly
                active time in Britain’s abolitionist movement, students wanted to know which “side”
                he was on, leading to what, to my mind, was and remains the most important critical
                point of discussing abolitionist politics. As I explained during that debate and
                continue to emphasize in my teaching, the terms used in the discussion about the
                transatlantic slave trade—abolition, emancipation, amelioration, freedom—do not
                necessarily correlate to notions of antiracism, equality, and equity. It is, I made
                clear, entirely possible for Blake to be opposed to slavery and still cling to
                racial hierarchies.</p>
                   
            <p>David Bindman’s “Blake’s Vision of Slavery Revisited” proved an especially useful
                follow-up to these questions about the poem. Although more recent readings of Blake
                and race have been published, Bindman’s essay offers a compelling, accessible
                history that answers students’ questions about Blake’s understanding of race and how
                consistent it is with the period. Bindman argues that Blake’s poem returns to
                debates about “the relationship of body to soul that, in the seventeenth and
                eighteenth centuries, had divided scientists from theologians in the discussion of
                racial differences,” though he also notes that the “notion that a black body might
                contain a white soul is expressed at least as early as the third century” (374).
                Bindman points us to work by Christopher Miller about how skin color was perceived
                in the Greco-Roman world. Miller cites a third-century C.E. epitaph for an enslaved
                Ethiopian: “Among the living I was very black, darkened by the rays of the sun, but
                my soul, ever blooming with white flowers, won my prudent master’s good will” (as
                cited by Miller, 374). The essay therefore models for students what is required to
                credibly reach the understanding that Bindman offers near the end of his essay, when
                he writes that the texts he discusses do not “cast doubt on the sincerity of Blake’s
                opposition to slavery,” but they do “suggest that Blake was unable to free
                    himself—<hi rend="italic">no more than anyone else at the time</hi>—from the
                complex and often contradictory web of ancient and modern beliefs that had settled
                around Africa and Africans in the late eighteenth century” (382; emphasis added).
                While I might quibble with the aside that I italicize above—and I share my
                disagreement with my students—I nonetheless have found Bindman’s essay exceptionally
                useful in showing students what they might need to think about and the kinds of
                research they might need to do when considering nineteenth-century representations
                of race.</p>
                   
            <p>Bindman’s article has been a mainstay whenever I teach Blake, and I pair it with
                Kwame Anthony Appiah’s “Race”—an essay that succinctly traces how race functions as
                a social construct in the nineteenth century and clearly explains that despite its
                constructedness, it still carries social weight: “For, however mythical the notion
                of race seems to be, we cannot deny the obvious fact that having one set of
                heritable characteristics—dark skin, say—rather than another—blonde hair, for
                example—can have profound psychological, economic, and other social consequences,
                especially in societies where many people are not only racialists but racists”
                (285). Appiah’s assertations here about “heritable characteristics” made some
                students uncomfortable: those who felt implicated by the idea that the
                characteristics they were born with have social capital and those who chafed against
                the idea that their characteristics may not overcome the obstacles they believe can
                be dismantled with education. My students are wary of the idea of “white privilege”
                because they associate it with economic wealth, but Appiah in this moment
                articulates what the “privilege” looks like, quite literally.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For notes on
                            how to talk about white privilege with undergraduates, see my blog post
                            “Afro-Pedagogy: The Poetry of Race and Privilege.”</note>
                Despite their discomfort, students responded well to the accessibility of Appiah’s
                analogies and, as a result, were better prepared to do the more difficult conceptual
                work it takes to understand how he lays out the consequent process of nation
                building and understandings of race: “the dual connection made in eighteenth- and
                nineteenth-century thought between, on the one hand, race and nationality, and, on
                the other, nationality and literature”; thus “the nation is the key middle term in
                understanding the relations between the concept of race and the idea of literature”
                (282).</p>
                   
            <p>Appiah also addresses the impact of the idea of race as a social construction, an
                idea that too many of my students have turned to as a way to dismiss racism. In the
                “Writing for the Major” course, students also watched his interview with the editor
                of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs</hi>. His observations in the interview
                prompted open and productive conversations about race and racism in which students’
                curiosity about the history of race and earnest desire to understand how racism works
                overcame some of the defensiveness and anxiety they felt about a topic that became
                increasingly fraught as their understanding of the world as racially just was
                undermined by national events.</p>
                   
            <p>Although the “Writing for the Major” course began with “The Little Black Boy,” and
                other readings included poetry and prose by William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor
                Coleridge, and Robert Southey, the class was less explicitly about Romanticism as a
                literary period and more about the uses of literary analysis and research to
                understand the relationship between literature and political movements. The goal was
                for students to consider how poets and novelists contribute to and shape national
                debates by paying attention to the rhetoric that abolitionists used to persuade
                their fellow citizens to support abolition, amelioration, or emancipation. I
                organized the course around a set of themes that often overlapped: consumer culture,
                gender, and religious ideology. In addition to reading “The Little Black Boy,” the
                course began with two exercises: a conversation about the various ways that civic
                groups try to effect broad change and a low-stakes free-association exercise about
                the word <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi>. The exercise involving sugar initially struck
                them as odd because the commodity they most associate with slavery is cotton.
                However, in addition to preparing them for the way that the sweetener was integral
                to abolitionist politics, the free-association exercise helped them understand how a
                consumable object morphs into the imaginary and metaphoric. Without fail, each time
                I taught the class the free association began with “honey” and invariably ended with
                students listing songs that mention “Sugar Daddy” in their titles or lyrics. This
                conflation of commodity, commerce, and desire prepared them for a discussion of Mick
                Jagger and Tina Turner’s 1988 performance of “Brown Sugar.” This song, originally
                released on the Rolling Stones’s 1971 album <hi rend="italic">Sticky Fingers,</hi>
                was still familiar to most of them as one they grew up hearing. They may never have
                seen the Turner-Jagger performance, but they recognize the opening chords and know
                the start of the chorus. Students watched the video without the benefit of having
                the lyrics in front of them and then listened to the song again while reading the
                lyrics. The conversation sparked by what the lines reveal was not as angry as the
                debate about Blake, but it was intense:
                
                <lg type="section">
            <l>Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields</l>
            <l>Sold in the market down in New Orleans</l>
            <l>Skydog slaver know he’s doin’ all right</l>
            <l> Hear him whip the women, just around midnight.</l>
                </lg>
                
            I want to be clear here that the point of this exercise was not to hunt for moments
                of popular culture and vet them for their politics. Instead, I wanted to show
                students the long reach of the tropes that they were about to encounter. Still, in
                each class some sort of debate ensued. Some students felt guilty for liking the
                song. In one class, a few of the Black women tried to convince their classmates that
                Jagger is satirizing and mocking English history, while others were unsure of what
                to make of Turner’s full-throated participation in the performance. These early
                class exercises primed students to push past any neat assumptions about race and
                abolition in the Romantic period and in contemporary representations of Black women
                in literature, visual culture, and film. It also prepared them to think along with
                Christina Sharpe when we listened to her response to Kara Walker’s art installation,
                “The Subtlety.” Sharpe not only provided a pointed critique of Walker and her use of
                the Black female form but also offered a model for students about how to ask
                productive questions from the texts they read and see.</p>
                   
            <p>In addition to “The Little Black Boy,” the primary texts in the class included
                Coleridge’s 1795 lecture “On the Slave Trade,” Southey’s six-sonnet sequence “Poems
                on the Slave Trade,” Amelia Opie’s “The Black Man’s Lament; or, How to Make Sugar,”
                Wordsworth’s “The Mad Mother,” and Hannah More and Eaglesfield Smith’s “The Sorrows
                of Yamba,” a poem that students found particularly compelling when they were
                assigned an excerpt from Alan Richardson’s essay about its creation, “‘The Sorrows
                of Yamba,’ by Eaglesfield Smith and Hannah More: Authorship, Ideology, and the
                Fractures of Antislavery Discourse.” The excerpt I used from Richardson’s essay was
                particularly generative. Students read the poem over two class periods. In the first
                class, their work with the poem was a mix of their initial reactions and my lecture
                on motherhood and infanticide. On the second day, I used the excerpt from the essay
                to take students back to the primary text and asked them to identity what in the
                poem supports Richardson’s claim that he “will establish the dual authorship of the
                Cheap Repository ‘Sorrows of Yamba’ on the basis both of external evidence
                (including new evidence that I discovered in the course of preparing a collection of
                British antislavery poems) and internal evidence,” and that “a crucial part of the
                argument—for the priority and relative integrity of Smith’s version of the
                poem—depends almost wholly on internal evidence, but of an unusually persuasive
                kind” (par. 4). This exercise was particularly rewarding for students who had
                completed the reading before class and followed my recommendation to mark passages
                they found intriguing and/or troubling. Those who read the poem carefully reported a
                “feeling” about how it sounded. They couldn’t quite articulate what was happening in
                the poem until we discussed Richardson’s analysis in class. Having Richardson affirm
                their initial thinking about the poem not only rewarded their close reading but also
                opened a dialogue between students and Richardson that didn’t require my
                guidance.</p>
                   
            <p>Richardson’s analysis was also a useful way to show students the limits of thinking
                about our primary texts as infallible historical documents. One risk of a course
                such as this, especially when students start the semester completely unaware of
                England’s connection to the slave trade, is to read the literary as an historical
                account of the experiences of the enslaved. My students tended to forget this, but
                it was especially important for them to think carefully not only about the
                difference between fact and fiction but also about how the idea of specific
                audiences shapes the way information is constructed. For example, as they read
                Olaudah Equiano’s and Mary Prince’s narratives about slavery, I asked them to be
                mindful of the fact that these histories were written for a white audience.</p>
                   
            <p>These opening exercises gave students a set of signposts to look for as they read,
                making it easier for their initial encounters with the assigned texts. This made
                even the most tedious poems, like Opie’s “How to Make Sugar,” manageable, but it
                didn’t help much with Coleridge’s “Lecture on the Slave Trade.” That essay needs a
                great deal of glossing to help students understand the many references to people and
                places they don’t know, and it is written to be heard rather than read. I had to
                develop a rhetorical map to help students understand it. Many of them believed that
                Coleridge’s recitation of pro-slavery arguments that he later dismantles were
                actually his own beliefs and ideas, so we read the lecture as much for the structure
                of his argument as for his thoughts about the slave trade. Students analyzed the
                tonal shifts in the essay—from its bombastic opening, to its almost clinical
                recitation of the arguments for slavery that he is challenging, to its use of
                poetry. I noted that he is a preacher, a parliamentarian, and a poet all in one
                lecture and then asked them to identify which moments in the lecture fit under those
                categories.</p>
                   
                   <p>Coleridge's “Lecture on the Slave Trade” provides a useful introduction  to Southey’s antislavery sonnet series. In
                the preface to the six sonnets that grow increasingly violent in tone, Southey
                speculates about the necessary conditions for the slave trade to end and explains how ending the consumption of West Indian sugar will contribute to its dissolution. 
                After briefly describing the 1792
                anti-sugar campaigns, he predicts: “There are yet two other methods remaining, by
                which this traffic will probably be abolished. By the introduction of East-Indian or
                Maple Sugar, or by the just and general rebellion of the Negroes; by the vindictive
                justice of the Africans, or by the civilized Christians finding it in their interest
                to be humane” (31). Students read Coleridge and Southey about midway through the
                semester, and Southey’s predictions about the conditions necessary for abolition
                offered a prompt for them to revisit the question of what mechanisms are required
                for meaningful societal change.</p>
                   
            <p>When it came to student work in this course, I aimed to develop a series of
                assignments that reflected how my students imagined their lives after college. When
                I was a new professor, my writing assignments did not offer students enough options.
                But a course titled “Writing for the Major” required me to consider new ways to
                think about what the work of writing does for students and to imagine ways to
                encourage student agency about their education. In his chapter “Anassignment
                Letters,” Fred Moten writes to his students about the inherent contradiction of
                cultivating their intellectual work while imposing institutional structures on them
                in the form of a series of assignments. The nature of assignments, he explains,
                neutralizes whatever revolutionary ideals he might hold, leaving him as “nothing
                other than an overseer even if what [he teaches] appears, at the level of its
                content, to resist the actually existing political-economic order” (229). Moten
                wants to mitigate the tension between the coercive practices he sees himself as
                imposing on his students and his belief that his primary job is to support them as
                they cultivate and refine their intellectual practices. What this has meant for my
                praxis is to think of assignments as preparing students to make a choice about how
                they present their analytical work. Roughly a third of my students have plans to
                teach English, primarily in high school. Working with them to develop a
                research-based lesson plan was a useful, organic way to assess how they took primary
                readings, class discussions, journal articles, and their earlier papers and
                restructured parts of them for their future students. “The Little Black Boy” lesson
                plans, for example, took what in a university classroom ends up being two 30-minute
                class discussions and broke it down into three or four days for younger
                students.</p>
                   
            <p>It was also an instructive glimpse into how my students processed material with an
                eye toward what they needed from me. They tended to be more interested in providing
                the “history” around the poem, and they learned how important it is to spend time
                debunking the myth that historians are simply offering a fixed report of the past.
                Giving students choices about their writing also amplified their interest in the course
                readings. They understood that assignments which at first glance felt like busy work
                actually helped them think about their analytical processes for their final project.
                The assignment that required them to read two refereed journal articles made more
                sense to them because it was not simply offering them “context” but also showing
                them how to engage with complex representations and ideologies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleman’s
                            “Conspicuous Consumption” was very popular, especially for students
                            looking for a way to understand what ungirds women’s participation in
                            abolitionist discourse. By far the most popular was Brown’s “Olaudah
                            Equiano and the Sailor’s Telegraph.” Students tend to find Equiano
                            particularly compelling, and Brown’s reading of the memoir points to
                            moments of community and egalitarianism that I suspect appeal to their
                            need for hopeful moments of solidarity in a violent
                        ecosystem.</note></p>

            <p>The graduate seminars I teach in my department’s M.A. program are a mix of students
                planning for doctoral studies, teachers seeking the Master of Arts in Teaching, and
                students interested in a graduate-level engagement with literature. The course I
                planned for this group in 2018 provided an opportunity to bring primary texts into
                dialogue with critical race theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent
                Romanticist critical discourses that reimagine the postcolonial project. Here is the
                full description from the syllabus:
                
            <quote>Students in this course will consider how our understanding of nineteenth-century
                Britain shifts when we take into account how much of the culture that gave us Percy
                Bysshe Shelley, Jane Austen, and, eventually, the Brontës relied on the
                transatlantic slave trade. Our work will focus on Romantic-era writers who shaped,
                reflected, and contributed to England’s abolitionist movement. We will read
                antislavery writing by canonical poets (Blake, Coleridge, and Wordsworth); consider
                the rhetorical moves in Ottobah Cugoano’s
                <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evils of Slavery </hi>[1791]
                and Olaudah Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> [1789]; and read
                novels and novel fragments that tell the story of mixed-race heroines, including
                <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour, A Tale </hi>[1808] and
                    <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam</hi>
                [1838]. We will also read a few antislavery poems and lectures with an eye towards
                thinking about how representations of people of color are shaped by generic
                conventions. The abolitionist movement is one of the first political events British
                white women organized themselves around, so we will pay special attention to
                nineteenth-century women writers including Jane Austen (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanditon</hi> [comp. 1817]), Maria Edgeworth (“The Grateful Negro”), Amelia
                Opie (<hi rend="italic">Adeline Mowbray</hi> [1804]), and Mary Wollstonecraft
                (excerpts from <hi rend="italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> [1792]).
                In addition to these primary texts, we will also consider the period’s material and
                visual culture and spend time thinking about how antislavery ideologies are
                reinterpreted in popular culture. We’ll read these primary texts in the context of
                Critical Race Theory, feminist literary criticism, and emergent Romanticist critical
                discourses that reimagine the postcolonial project.</quote>
                   
            In the first few classes, students reacted to this course in a number of ways, almost
                all of which resisted its premise. Some of this was, I suspect, the natural
                performance of skepticism that graduate students bring to courses as they feel their
                way through the dynamics of the class. Some of the resistance was based on how much
                this course differed from how they had been taught Romanticism as undergraduates.
                However much they had read of the period before they took my course, these students
                tended to understand it as a period where there are no Black people or people of
                color, no questions about identity, race, and citizenship, and where the only
                revolutionary activities took place in France. Even students sympathetic to the idea
                of race and representation in the period were skeptical about the seminar, thinking
                that my approach to our reading was a theoretical or temporal sleight of hand. This
                was one of the reasons I didn’t begin this course with Wordsworth’s “To Toussaint
                L’Ouverture.” With its “whistling rustic” and “common wind,” Wordsworth’s sonnet
                reads to students as consistent with Romantic tropes in general and the aesthetics
                of his work. When we did read the poem later in the semester, we followed it with C.
                L. R James’s <hi rend="italic">The Black Jacobins</hi> (1938), which helped reorient
                students to the geographies of slavery and abolition. For students trained in
                African American studies, this class was a revelation that invited them to revisit
                the “trans” in “transatlantic slave trade.” For so many of them the history of the
                transatlantic slave trade has elided England’s role in it and the hollowness of
                “emancipation.”</p>
                   
            <p>The most animated class discussions were sparked by <hi rend="italic">The Woman of
                    Colour, A Tale</hi> (1808). Even though they preferred reading novels to poetry,
                graduate students loved and hated <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour</hi> in
                equal measure. The novel, which tells the story of the daughter of an enslaved Black
                woman and a planter with family in England, disrupts their expectations of both the
                “tragic mulatto” narrative and the courtship novel. Many students confessed that
                they wanted the heroine, Olivia Fairfield, to recover from her marriage to a
                bigamist by marrying an early suitor in the novel and wrestled with their own need
                for a happy ending that concludes with nuptials rather than the independence that
                comes with being a wealthy woman who returns with no master—chattel to no man, free
                from her father’s bizarre will requiring her to marry a distant cousin in order to
                inherit, emancipated from the racist strictures of British society—to her home in
                Jamaica. In response to the revelation that Olivia’s supposed husband, August
                Merton, already has a wife, her servant Dido announces that she “<hi rend="italic"
                    >has no</hi> master” after the biracial heroine discovers that her husband is an
                accidental bigamist (141). Dido is not only furious about how her mistress has been
                treated by her husband’s family but is also frustrated to find herself demoted from
                a grand home to a more modest cottage. We thought about the idea of a “master” in
                multiple registers—as the titular head of a wealthy English home and, given that
                Dido is from Jamaica and marked linguistically as other, as a man who bought and
                sold captured African women and men or could claim legal ownership from birth. We
                also thought about Dido’s body and the space she and Olivia occupy materially and
                imaginatively in the novel. The text’s inflections of marriage and/as slavery and
                women and/as chattel underscored our discussions of all the fiction we read. We
                compared Olivia to Wollstonecraft’s description of ideal women in <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi>.</p>
                   
            <p>Student resistance to the course’s central goal diminished as the semester
                progressed, but it was replaced by an intellectual sentimentalism that I found
                reductive. In my essay on a similar subject (“Jane Austen and the Abolitionist
                Turn”), I talk about the collegial but earnest tug-of-war I have with graduate
                students who want to make the work of reading about race and representation in
                eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain into a cause. While I admire the
                intentions behind this idea, I find I am ambivalent about some of the projects that
                emerge from this stance. This is in part a reaction to the way such an approach is
                framed. Projects that work to question our assumptions about Romanticism and its
                entanglements with race and representation make sense. These interrogations tend to
                stay tightly focused, and they rely on the kind of archival thinking that a scholar
                like Rebecca Schneider deploys in her essay “‘He says he is free’: Narrative
                Fragments and Self-Emancipation in West Indian Runaway Advertisements.” I worry
                about an approach that treats these works as ways to “humanize” people of color by
                reading the primary texts (the literary and the historical) as documentaries that
                teach us about the past. They don’t. They show us select representations of the
                past. As Marcus Wood observes in his study of visual representations of slavery,
                “The experiences of millions of individuals who were the victims of slavery is not
                collectable; it is unrecoverable as a set of relics. There can be no archeology of
                the memory of slavery that corresponds to an emotional identification with a lost
                reality” (7). Those representations certainly influence our contemporary notions of
                race, but Britain’s abolitionist project feels too complex to be read as a template
                for what we can and cannot do in the twenty-first century. It is a viewpoint that is
                appealing to students who are less interested in literary analysis and more invested
                in sociological projects. The problem with this approach is that it replicates the
                same problematic assumptions about who we read, so that writers are good or bad
                depending on how they feed into our notions of social justice. As I discuss below by
                way of conclusion, this is different than the connections my undergraduates make
                between abolitionist-era politics and this contemporary moment. Despite reading many
                of the same texts, undergraduates tend to identify structural similarities between
                the two periods, especially the way that British abolitionists construct themselves
                in relationship to the Black figures they claim to support. Graduate students,
                especially women of color and white women, tend to see in the struggles of the past
                their own oppressive experiences.</p>
                   
            <p>One way this is evident is in reactions to Olivia Fairfield in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Woman of Colour</hi>. Whereas, as I note above, graduate students wrestle with
                wanting a traditional, heteronormative ending for Olivia, undergraduates are
                exasperated with her for not confronting the bigotry she encounters. They tend to
                have no interest in the idea of her marrying. They see that legal and social
                contracts have failed her, and their focus tends to stay on that fact. The different
                responses certainly reflect when and how students engage with this material.
                Undergraduates are still developing the analytic skills that graduate students are
                refining on the way to planning longer projects that will make critical
                interventions into existing discourse. Their different reactions also reflect the
                readings that students bring to the class. In the graduate seminar, most of the
                students were very familiar with Regency-era literature and read it by choice. I
                think that for them Olivia Fairfield was a brown version of the white heroines they
                read for pleasure and for escape. Undergraduates encountered her in the context of
                abolitionist debates. As a result, they see her as yet another person of color
                navigating nineteenth-century racism. Generally speaking, perhaps both groups are
                simply projecting their own values onto the text, and I prefer the projection that
                aligns with my own thinking. I get excited when I see my students recognizing
                patterns of structural violence and nervous when they individualize what they read
                in my classes. The latter seems to me more a starting point than the end of an
                intellectual project. This seems a good pedagogical problem to have; in both cases
                students are animated about and engaged with the work of understanding an ecosystem
                that they still see as operating today.</p>

            <p>I want students to see my class discussions—indeed, my class as a
                whole—as a place to work out ideas and a space free from punitive critique and the
                pressure to perform a particular politics. I have been gratified when they make
                connections between our reading and the contemporary political landscape, and I have
                been relieved when they feel they can talk about their political concerns in my
                class. What I admired about the student’s “WTF??!!?” has happened in classes again,
                in more muted but no less intense ways. After the 2016 election, many of the
                students who enrolled in my section of “Writing for the Major” did so because they
                saw it as a space where they could talk about the racist violence they saw in the
                country. The words “Black Lives Matter” were never spoken. But Black students in the
                class were very open about the fear they felt. I will always remember the Black
                woman who said, “I feel like I have to fight the same battles my ancestors already
                won.” The white students around her were visibly shocked by her candor. With no
                prompting from me, students in the class were more likely to choose research
                projects that connected representations of violence in abolitionist culture to
                violence they were reading about in the news. One student, for example, wrote a
                research essay about Equiano’s description of psychological violence and the case of
                Kalief Browder, wrongly imprisoned after police suspected him of stealing a
                backpack. Another student prepared a research presentation that traced depictions of
                Black women’s bodies from Sarah Baartman to the present, revisiting Christina
                Sharpe’s discussion of Kara Walker. Among themselves, students started discussing
                the challenges and risks of confronting racist moments in their lives away from
                school. Ava DuVernay’s documentary <hi rend="italic">13</hi><hi
                    rend="sup">th</hi> was released in October 2016; by 2017 some of
                my students had watched the film, and they brought it up enough in class discussions
                that their peers watched it, too.</p>
                   
            <p>There were difficult debates, as well. Smart, thoughtful students asked earnest
                questions with racist overtones, and I had to walk a fine line. I had to moderate
                those discussions without giving students who were asking troubling questions the
                impression that they were being dismissed, and while also protecting the
                sensibilities of other students who would feel those questions most keenly because
                of their “heritable characteristics.” In those discussions, Coleridge’s lecture was
                quite helpful. He lays out five pro-slavery arguments and then debunks them. In more
                than one class, skeptical students benefitted from our close attention to what
                underscored the pro-slavery debates that Coleridge references.</p>
                   
            <p>In the scant ground of a course reading list, it can be particularly challenging to
                include new authors, especially if one wants to go about the work with care. As
                Miriam Wallace and I noted in our <hi rend="italic">Romantic Circles</hi> special
                issue (2008), Annette Kolodny is right when she describes the challenges of changing
                what and how we teach: “Radical breaks are tiring, demanding, uncomfortable, and
                sometimes wholly beyond our comprehension” (12). But I think the outcomes are worth
                the effort, and no one taking on this work is doing so alone. There are so many
                resources available and models to follow. I am thinking especially of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</hi> digital humanities
                project (2020). The site is a repository of peer-reviewed syllabi, recorded
                discussions about teaching, and sample units for faculty use. Similar projects are
                in the works for eighteenth-century studies as well. An abolitionist Romanticism
                course captures most students’ imaginations because they tend to think of slavery
                and abolition as uniquely American. Thinking about race, racism, and slavery in a
                British context gives them space to work out knotty, unnerving questions about these
                complex issues. At the same time, it helps them read contemporary progressive
                movements in more nuanced ways. I have found that in learning about an abolitionist
                Romanticism, students are not only studying historical texts and their connection to
                a movement, they are also learning more about the intricacies of society, protest,
                and revolution.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
                <p>In her recent essay about Mansfield Park (1814), Lynn Festa defines noise in Jane Austen’s novel as those sounds 
                    that we can hear but may not be linguistically legible, such as the cries of the Atlantic slave trade. This essay 
                    invites us to listen for noise in the soundscape of antislavery poetry. Focusing on the commonly overlooked tunes of 
                    ballads, I reveal the complicated politics of musical haunting in two canonical antislavery ballads: William Cowper’s 
                    “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and Hannah More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba” (1797). These ballads were set to the tune of an 
                    older song, Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), which mourns the deaths of thousands of English sailors from 
                    yellow fever in the Spanish West Indies. I model an exercise that invites readers to open their ears to the white noise in 
                    poetry about slavery and to think critically about the politics of formal, racial, and historical possession.

            <p>For those of us who study and teach the literature of slavery and abolition,
                listening for silences as attentively as voices is a matter of ethical urgency.
                Since the publication of Gayatri Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern Speak?” (1988), critics
                who write about the colonial and postcolonial world have been faced with the
                challenge of listening beyond voice, which, in the texts we tend to teach, is so
                essentially constructed by and for the Western subject. The problem with voice is
                its privilege—only few can speak, and even fewer are actually heard. Silence too
                poses its own interpretive challenges. We find the critical limitations of silence
                in Edward Said’s well-known interrogation of Jane Austen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mansfield Park</hi> (1814), a novel that notoriously dials down the volume on
                the subject of slavery and empire that haunts its geographic and fictional borders.
                Critics have taken turns defending Austen’s evident reserve on the slavery question
                in the novel.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            For a few excellent defenses of Austen on this front, see Boulukos;
                            Ferguson, “<hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>”; and
                        Fraiman.</note> Many have insisted that, if it is silent, Austen’s
                novel faithfully captures the taboo nature of the theme in its own historical
                context and assumes an implicit contemporary understanding of and sensitivity to the
                moral crisis at the center of the Bertram estate.</p>
                        
            <p>More recently, however, Lynn Festa has proposed that in <hi rend="italic">Mansfield
                    Park</hi> Austen may not be asking us to listen for the omissions that fill the
                novel’s silences so much as urging us to listen for what its <hi rend="italic"
                    >noise</hi> might tell us: “For we may hear but we do not usually <hi
                    rend="italic">listen</hi> to noise. . . . For who listens to noise? We moderns
                consider having a voice as fundamental to social and political representation, and
                silence is often equated with oppression” (152, 154). As Festa distinguishes here,
                listening for noise means paying attention to sounds we would otherwise block out
                because they are too raucous, inarticulate, or inconvenient. And in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, many things are noisy—the urbane Crawfords,
                the staging of <hi rend="italic">Lover’s Vows</hi>, and, of course, Fanny Price’s
                questions about the slave trade at the dinner table. Though Fanny’s timid inquiries
                about slavery threaten to disrupt the tranquility of Mansfield Park, they hardly
                amount to the kind of political voice that Spivak problematizes, nor do they qualify
                as silence within the terms of Said’s famous critique, even if she is in fact
                silenced. If Fanny’s questions fall on deaf ears, it is not because they do not echo
                in the room but because they travel at an inconvenient frequency. “When Austen asks
                us to hear noise,” Festa observes, “she is asking us to recognize that noise is <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> simply what needs to be blocked out to hear the ‘real’
                message, like the static that makes the radio hard to hear. It may be something—in
                this respect, noise is like Fanny—that we need to listen <hi rend="italic">for</hi>”
                (153). In other words, listening for noise means being alert to the static in the
                soundscape of the imperial world that so often escapes representation. Pondering the
                marked noisiness of <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, Festa concludes that
                Austen implores us to open our ears to precisely this kind of imperial static.</p>
                        
            <p>In this essay I propose that we accept Festa’s invitation to listen for noise in the
                literature of slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world. Instead of attending to
                fiction, however, I invite us to listen to the poetry that fills the archive. Poetry
                is obviously rich in sound—meter, rhyme, alliteration, and so forth—but its <hi
                    rend="italic">noise</hi>, as Festa has defined it, is not always something that
                is heard or listened for. Fortunately for us, the archive of slavery contains plenty
                of poetry, primarily because abolitionists understood verse as a powerful medium
                that arouses the moral sentiments. One of the most popular forms embraced by
                antislavery poets was the ballad, a poetic genre that is particularly noisy because
                it reverberates a national history and an oral tradition that is only rarely
                attended to. While balladeers construct a voice (or voices) in their ballads, other
                historical noises haunt the form, including a musical tradition. When I teach
                ballads by abolitionist poets like William Cowper and Hannah More in my classroom, I
                begin by asking my students to examine the formal and rhetorical strategies that
                these white writers used to construct enslaved Black voices. Part of this exercise,
                however, requires that we listen beyond the constructed voice found on the surface
                of the poem to the musical history that today only comes through as static, or, as
                Festa proposes, as noise. Rarely do teachers of poetry pay attention to ballad tune
                (or melody) but doing so can sometimes help clarify the political stakes of a poem.
                In Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788) and More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba” (1797),
                this musical dimension allows us to access a British imperial history through a
                melody that enriches our political sense of these poems. For contemporaries of
                Cowper and More, old ballad tunes might affect listeners given their own familiarity
                with national songs, but for today’s readers of poetry tunes are more often than not
                meaningless static. In what follows I consider the ballad’s media history as a kind
                of meaningful noise that, in the context of British slavery and abolition, raises
                important questions about the limits of political representation and voice for
                enslaved subjects.</p>
                        
            <p>I teach eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century British antislavery ballads
                alongside M. NourbeSe Philip’s astounding collection of poems, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> (2008), which taps into a related but altogether distinct form of
                static—the noise in the law. Philip’s title refers to the infamous
                eighteenth-century slave ship that became the subject of a horrific and historic
                British legal case, <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> (1783). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong</hi> witnessed the intentional mass drowning of over one
                hundred enslaved Africans in order to claim an insurance policy on its human cargo,
                a great fraction of which had become sick at sea from disease or malnourishment.
                When the insurance company refused to pay out the claim on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi>’s enslaved cargo, William Gregson and his syndicate brought the case
                to trial. While technically tried as a disagreement about an insurance policy, the
                case opened up a host of ethical questions regarding the treatment of the enslaved at sea.
                The chief justice, Lord Mansfield, who presided over several landmark cases devoted
                to the slave trade, ultimately ruled against the owners of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> on a technicality—evidence arose in the ship’s log that rainfall had
                ameliorated the water shortage that Gregson and his crew claimed made the cargo
                disposable. Philip’s extraordinary project in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is to
                listen for the noise of slavery in the legal documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson
                    v. Gilbert</hi> and to reconstruct poems using only that language to offer
                testimony that was inadmissible at the time of the trial, testimony that could only
                be dismissed as legal noise. My aim in pairing antislavery and contemporary poems in
                this class is to underscore the precarity of political voice in the slavery archive.
                To this end I engage my students in a conversation about the limits of poetic
                justice in verse about transatlantic slavery by uncovering the profound historical
                and interpretive potential of what I have outlined here as noise.</p>

            <head>II. Ballad Noise</head>
            <p>The task of listening for noise in antislavery ballads is perhaps more challenging
                than in a study of fiction because, of course, poetry is so noisy. At the same time,
                critics and teachers of poetry are used to being attentive to sounds that students
                or lay readers may not listen for. Beyond listening to narrative or voice in poetry,
                there is also meter, rhythm, rhyme, and alliteration, frequent topics of discussion
                in any class on poetry. In the case of the ballad, however, there is also tune.
                Music is often overlooked because the literary study of the ballad tradition since
                the nineteenth century deprioritized tune in favor of qualities like lyric voice, a
                shift that all but rendered tune an inconsequential noise. Prior to the nineteenth
                century, however, printed ballads were understood as lyrics accompanied by a musical
                score that functioned as a deeply meaningful dimension to any ballad. Music works on
                us in a way that precedes cognition and can possess us like a spirit from without.
                In the ballad tradition tunes were recycled for new poems, which meant that modern
                ballads often carried a tune from a much older song. This detail in the ballad’s
                media history places the genre in a special category in the poetic tradition because
                ballads carry a musical past that is now commonly ignored as <hi rend="italic"
                    >noise</hi>.</p>
                        
            <p>Two canonical eighteenth-century antislavery ballads carry an old tune that we should
                listen for: Cowper’s “The Negro’s Complaint” and More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba.” The
                old song these poems echo is Richard Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” (1740), a
                naval ballad written during the Walpole era that celebrates a military victory in
                the Spanish West Indies and mourns the tragic and avoidable loss of thousands of
                English sailors to yellow fever on those waters. In Glover’s political ballad, the
                ghosts of these sailors call out to the reader or listener to be remembered for
                their service and sacrifice. In my classroom I invite my students to listen to
                Glover’s song, and I ask them what it might mean that the enslaved Black voices
                constructed by Cowper and More are mediated and amplified by a tune about thousands
                of white English sailors who perished at sea. Why would Cowper and More make such a
                formal decision? And what are some of the challenges that this decision poses for
                the political and literary representation of enslaved Africans during the abolition
                debate? In other words, I ask how we might read “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as a kind
                of meaningful noise.</p>
                        
            <p>All of these questions stem from a common problem—<hi rend="italic">mediation</hi>.
                Fortunately for us, the thematic ghostliness of Glover’s ballad allows us to bring
                all of the ways in which mediation is in play into clear focus. The most obvious
                starting point is thinking about the ballad as a poetic medium, not only in terms of
                the layered musical and lyrical richness I’ve already described but also as an oral
                form that migrated into print culture in the late eighteenth century as collections
                like Thomas Percy’s <hi rend="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi> (1765)
                were assembled. In fact, Percy included Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” in his
                popular compendium of national songs. As Celeste Langan and Maureen McLane have
                observed, poets of Cowper’s generation participated in finding a middle ground
                between oral and printed ballad forms in crafting new ballads during a period of
                media transition (242). Indeed, Cowper and More are members of the last generation
                of poets that seriously and intentionally engage the musical dimension of the
                ballad.</p>
                        
            <p>Another way to think about mediation in these poems is in spiritual terms. Mediums,
                after all, are those persons who channel spirits from another world to our own. In
                “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover performs the task of giving voice to the sailors
                haunting that poem. In the later antislavery ballads that carry its tune, the
                enslaved speakers function as another kind of medium altogether in their
                reverberation of the older naval song. These enslaved subjects both echo and jar
                against the voices of the sailors in Glover’s poem because their historical
                situations couldn’t be more different.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This conflation between sailor and slave may
                            recall Robert Southey’s “The Sailor who had Served in the Slave Trade”
                            (1798). In this ballad narrative, a sailor returns to England from the
                            “slave-coast” (110) traumatized by having been forced to beat a female
                            slave to death. Southey’s narrative exposes the communal trauma suffered
                            by everyone who participates in the institution of slavery, but he also
                            reveals the extent to which men like this sailor may similarly be
                            deprived of their will. While in Cowper’s and More’s ballads the slave
                            speakers are haunted by music expressing the plaints of dead sailors in
                            Glover’s song, Southey’s sailor is haunted by the enslaved victim he was
                            compelled to torture.</note> Further still, Cowper and More act
                as mediums for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Black voices they represent <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> the ghosts of Glover’s ballad. When I present the layered
                and haunted quality of these ballads in my classroom, my students are often
                surprised and provoked by the racial complexity of the voices they hear—the enslaved
                African speakers are politically mediated by both white poets and the spirits of
                white British sailors.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The relaying of voice found in Cowper’s and More’s
                            ballads offers a related but contrasting example of what Maureen McLane,
                            in <hi rend="italic">Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of
                                Romantic Poetry</hi> (2011), has identified in the remediation of
                            songs by Africans and Native Americans collected from imperial borders
                            (108). McLane examines ballads like Mungo Park’s “Negro’s Song” and Anne
                            Home Hunter’s “Cherokee Death Song,” published in Joseph Ritson’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Select Collection of English Songs</hi> (1783), as
                            examples of authentic African and American ditties returned to England,
                            where they are versified and set to music. This process of remediation
                            traces the migration of the song as it crosses imperial boundaries,
                            where the musical instruments and poetic forms of polite society
                            transform it for the English ear. Unlike these cases of English
                            lyricists bringing home tunes from imperial territories for remediation,
                            Cowper’s and More’s ballads are English songs dispatched across the
                            Atlantic and placed in the mouths of African slaves. But this dispatch,
                            oddly enough, returns to the scene of Hosier’s tragedy. Thus “Admiral
                            Hosier’s Ghost,” which experienced its own transatlantic vocalization,
                            uncannily wanders back to its place of origin—the Atlantic—only to be
                            revocalized by a foreign, racialized body for new political purposes. I
                            discuss this distinction in my own essay on this subject, “Lyric
                            Possession in the Abolition Ballad.” In teaching antislavery ballads,
                            one may emphasize this history of problematic international musical
                            dialogue and appropriation across the British Empire.</note>
                Understanding these layers, they are more fully aware of the rhetorical strategies
                and stakes involved in the ballad form in the abolition context.</p>
                        
            <p>What becomes clear in this triad of ballads is that haunting is both formal and
                political. “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” functions as a kind of historical white noise
                resounding in the later soundscapes of “The Negro’s Complaint” and “The Sorrows of
                Yamba.” In media studies, the term <hi rend="italic">white noise</hi> refers to
                static that exceeds the intended signal or message being transmitted. In the
                antislavery ballad tradition, I’m interested in thinking not only about music or
                tune as white noise in academic studies of the ballad but also in the racial
                implications of this music—the whiteness of the voices amplifying Black, enslaved
                speakers. Beyond this ghostly musical mediation, these poems also exhibit a kind of
                possession that is intrinsic to the ballad form. As Susan Stewart argues in her
                essay “Lyric Possession,” poets who write ballads are implicitly possessed by a
                national history as they broadcast an oral tradition in their revision of older
                songs. “Of all the singers of Western lyric,” Stewart writes, “the ballad singer is
                the one most radically haunted by others, for he or she presents the gestures, the
                symptoms, of a range of social actors, and he or she presents those gestures as
                symptoms of a previous action” (41). In other words, haunting is a formal process
                native to the very composition of ballads. The poet functions as a medium for
                historical action in their embodied composition of a new song according to an older
                musical and metrical schema. Stewart calls this “the submersion of will within
                convention” (40). In the poems we are dealing with, however, possession is just as
                political as it is formal insofar as they condemn an institution that supports the
                deprivation of human will. Bound by the formal imperatives of the ballad tradition,
                Cowper and More become strange mediums and precarious political representatives in
                their attempts to embody the experience of enslaved persons while conjuring a formal
                and national history. Moreover, the voices we find ringing in the ballads form a
                strange and spectral chorus of competing political pleas.</p>
                        
            <p>As scholars like Simon Gikandi, Laura Doyle, and Ian Baucom argue, the archive of
                Atlantic slavery is hauntological and generically marked by the gothic. One of the
                Afro-Caribbean spiritual practices that I share with my students in our discussion
                of lyric possession is <hi rend="italic">obeah</hi>, a common ritual among early
                slave communities in the West Indies. As Alan Richardson reveals in “Romantic
                Voodoo,” obeah was a slave practice that struck fear among the British in the
                Caribbean and in England after it began to appear in popular fiction and poetry in
                the late eighteenth century, as we find in William Earle’s sensational novel about
                obeah and the Jamaican folk hero Jack Mansong,
                    <hi rend="italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack </hi>(1800).<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Alan
                            Richardson proposes, representations of obeah increased anxiety and
                            agitation in the wake of slave uprisings (“Romantic Voodoo”). The
                            politics of lyric possession we find in the antislavery ballad seems in
                            dialogue with charged spiritual practices like obeah.</note>
                Accounts of obeah rituals also filled popular histories of the West Indies,
                including Edward Long’s <hi rend="italic">History of Jamaica</hi> (1774). These
                representations amplified colonial anxiety in the wake of slave rebellions in the
                West Indies and exacerbated national tensions generated by political revolutions in
                France, Haiti, and America. For our purposes, however, obeah might be considered as
                one form of imperial noise that echoed within British cultural production about
                slavery at this time. In its investment in ritual and incantation, we might also
                think about obeah as an Afro-Caribbean analogue to lyric possession, as we see in
                William Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation” (1797). In this poem, Shepherd parrots an
                obi priest via the ode form as he calls for “the white man’s doom” by spurring a
                slave insurgency using material rituals and lyric conjuring:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                    
                
            <l>Haste! the magic shreds prepare—</l>
            <l>Thus the white man’s corse we tear.</l>
            <l>Lo! feathers from the raven’s plume,</l>
            <l>That croaks our proud Oppressor’s doom.</l>
            <l>Now to aid the potent spell,</l>
            <l>Crush we next the brittle shell—</l>
            <l>Fearful omen to the foe,</l>
            <l>Look! the blanched bones we throw. (lines 25–32)</l>
                </lg>
                
                
           If the lyric possession we find in ballads by Cowper and More summons the specters of
                British imperial history through music, Shepherd invokes the spirit of obeah to
                craft a political ode designed to raise alarm about racial and imperial tensions in
                the West Indies. Discussing obeah alongside M. NourbeSe Philip’s own incantatory
                poetics raises fascinating questions about the limits of Western poetic forms like
                the ballad or the ode when framing historical Black voices. As Philip argues in her
                essay “Notanda” (included in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>), the project of rescuing
                enslaved Black voices from the history of British law required a poetic approach
                that exceeded the rationality of Western forms. The poems generated by Philip’s
                “irrational” approach to historical texts seem to echo the radical shamanistic
                practice of obeah in colonial life in ways that feel historically authentic and
                politically effective. Form, Philip teaches us, can sometimes speak so loudly as to
                drown out the voices that poetry is meant to broadcast. I will return to obeah in
                the next section.</p>
                        
            <p>By reading British antislavery and naval ballads together with my students, I aim to
                accomplish several things. First, I demonstrate how a Black voice is constructed in
                an antislavery ballad and generate discussion around the politics of that
                construction with special attention to the rhetoric of voice in each poem. Second, I
                teach my students about ballad form and its media history, including the element of
                music so often overlooked in the study of the ballad. Next, I share the political
                history of Glover’s “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” and comment on how it intersects with
                British transatlantic slavery. My goal at the end of these exercises is to invite
                students to think critically about what it means for Cowper and More to have chosen
                Glover’s song as a tune and a spirit for the voices of enslaved Black subjects in
                their poems.</p>
                        
            <p>My approach to these complex poems in the classroom is first to invite my students to
                close-read Cowper’s and More’s ballads together while paying close attention to
                voice. Whose voice(s) are we hearing? And, who is listening? I remind them that
                these are lyric poems by white English writers who construct an African subject and
                voice for an English audience. Our first exercise is to deconstruct that voice to
                understand the rhetorical strategies at work in the two poems, which are distinct in
                both message and approach. We find that Cowper’s African speaker makes a rational
                plea for liberation and challenges the reader to examine his or her own sense of
                justice in the face of the appeal. More’s Yamba, on the other hand, offers a much
                more sentimental and sympathetic voice whose tragic story is designed to appeal to
                our moral feelings. Moreover, Yamba echoes an Evangelical narrative in her turning
                to a missionary to find solace in a Christian life and its teachings. To shed light
                on each poet’s rhetorical strategy, I offer up biographical details about Cowper and
                More that give us some insight, including Cowper’s religious mania and isolation and
                More’s commitment to practical and religious teachings for the working-class public
                in writings like the Cheap Repository Tracts series (where “Yamba” appeared). These
                biographical details help students understand that there are personal traces of
                Cowper and More in the Black voices they construct<note place="foot" resp="author"> More’s “The Sorrows of Yamba”
                            introduces new complications to the political voice constructed in the
                            abolition ballad. Richardson has exposed a fascinating conflict of
                            authorial voice in the poem’s textual history. According to Richardson,
                            the poem was originally penned by a minor Scottish poet, Eaglesfield
                            Smith, and first published in <hi rend="italic">Universal Magazine</hi>
                            in 1797; it was subsequently expanded by More in an anonymous
                            republication in the highly popular Cheap Repository Tracts series,
                            which promoted middle-class values of religious and social obedience.
                            Such mixed and unstable authorship underscores the plurality of voices
                            native to the ballad form; it also highlights an Anglo-Scottish colonial
                            ideological problem that plays itself out in the poem’s variants. What
                            was, in Smith’s hands, an outright critique of imperial commerce
                            parroted by an African voice turns into a much less censorious narrative
                            about Christian conversion and Yamba’s forgiveness of her masters in
                            More’s version (Richardson, “‘Sorrows of Yamba’”). For a discussion of
                            the centrality of gender in the construction of the slave voice in the
                            literature of sensibility, see Mellor; see also Ferguson, <hi
                                rend="italic">Subject to Others</hi> (1992).</note> One of
                the awkward attunements we find in More’s poem is that it displays an attempt at
                Afro-Caribbean dialect. This is common among ballads in the abolition archive and
                significant because ballads must also adhere to the genre’s metrical patterns. What
                does it mean, I ask my students, that poets attempted dialect while at the same time
                accommodating the voice to English ballad meter? Finally, I contextualize the poems
                in the wider historical landscape, pointing out that More’s poem was composed after
                the beginning of the French and Haitian revolutions, which may account for its more
                conservative tone and narrative. I often generate discussion around the political
                efficacy of each ballad by asking students to compare their strengths and
                weaknesses.</p>
                        
            <p>Because these poems were distributed as broadsides and our attention is on ballad
                media, I share images of both broadsides with my students. As popular forms,
                broadsides were inexpensive literature and news media that circulated widely in town
                centers (coffee houses and taverns, for example) and eventually migrated out into
                the country. As the historian of abolition Brycchan Carey has shown, a ballad
                reproduced on broadsheets could circulate rapidly, particularly if the ballad was
                set to a recognizable form and tune (100). Abolitionists working with the Society
                for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade understood the importance of
                inexpensive print materials as they sought to reach a wide popular audience, and the
                broadside was an ideal vehicle for their message. The broadsides printed for
                Cowper’s and More’s ballads usually advertised “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” as the tune
                for their poems underneath the title. Glover’s song was a popular tune that one
                might hear played in an eighteenth-century drawing room, and so I make sure to play
                a recording of the song, accessible to everyone on YouTube (Craig), in my classroom.
                The purpose of this demonstration is to immerse my students in the ballad’s media
                history. In the past I have even printed the ballads on single sheets so that
                students might read the poems as the tune plays. Once students hear the tune, they
                are immediately struck by the awkwardness of framing an enslaved voice in the tunes
                and metrical frameworks of polite society. A productive conversation can emerge from
                reflecting on the aesthetic effects of these formal choices when students are
                reminded of the intended British audience and the sensitive political debate around
                slavery happening at the time. In order for the British public to connect and
                sympathize with an enslaved African subject, that subject needed to sound as British
                as possible.</p>
                        
            <p>Next, we turn to the broadside for “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” which features a
                striking political cartoon of maritime specters rising from the Caribbean Sea. I
                offer my students an account of the dynamic political climate surrounding Glover’s
                poem and some details about Glover himself. Descended from the merchant class in
                London, Glover supported the financial interests of trading companies that
                trafficked across the Atlantic, including companies that bought and sold African
                slaves (Baines). In the early eighteenth century, British trading vessels were
                routinely attacked and raided by Spanish ships. Because Robert Walpole was reluctant
                to go to war with Spain at this time, London merchants heavily criticized his lack
                of aggression against Spanish interference in the West Indies (Rodger 234). When
                Walpole sent Vice-Admiral Francis Hosier and his fleet to conduct a blockade along
                the mosquito-infested waters off Porto Bello, a Spanish settlement in what is now
                Panama, in 1726, over three thousand sailors contracted yellow fever and died.
                Seeing his opportunity to criticize Walpole, Glover drafted “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                to remind the British public of the fatal consequences of Walpole’s refusal simply
                to overtake the Spanish port. In the poem, Hosier’s spirit rises from the waters
                near Porto Bello to relate his melancholy tale to Admiral Edward Vernon, who
                successfully sacked Porto Bello twelve years later, in 1739. The ballad thus mourns
                the lives of the sailors lost at Porto Bello due to Walpole’s military failure,
                while celebrating Vernon’s later victory for Britain.</p>

                Hosier’s Ghost,” by Richard Glover (1740), colored etching by C. Mosley (1740).
                National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London.&gt;</p>
                        
            <p>In “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Glover’s strategy is to exhume recent history from the
                sea for political purposes, which is also the strategy employed by Cowper and More
                in their later antislavery ballads. When we read the poem in the classroom, I ask
                students to consider the dead sailors’ spectral plea to be remembered for their
                sacrifice in the midst of imperial triumph. Hosier’s ghost rises from the waters and
                addresses the victorious Vernon on behalf of his crew:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                    
                
            <l>See these mournful Spectres sweeping,</l>
            <l>Ghastly, o’er this hated wave,</l>
            <l>Whose wan Cheeks are stain’d with weeping:</l>
            <l>These were English Captains brave:</l>
            <l>Mark those Numbers pale and horrid,</l>
            <l>Who were once my sailors bold,</l>
            <l>Lo, each hangs his drooping Forehead,</l>
            <l>While his dismal Fate is told. (lines 32–40)</l>
                    
                </lg>
                
            I ask my students to think about what this plea for remembrance means when the tune
                of Glover’s poem transfers the sentiment to the tongue of the enslaved speaker in
                Cowper’s and More’s later ballads. As a way to think through this question, I offer
                more historical context on Porto Bello. In the early eighteenth century, Porto Bello
                was a major Spanish outpost for the slave trade, and historians reveal that many
                slaves in the region suffered and died of the very yellow fever that claimed Hosier
                and his men (Lohse 74–109). While it is not at all surprising that these African
                voices are not heard in Glover’s ballad, it is significant that Cowper and More
                later give voice to their own enslaved speakers by echoing, at least musically, the
                voices of the sailors from that original ballad. In other words, the noise of
                slavery ringing in Porto Bello was muted in Glover’s ballad and only becomes audible
                in the antislavery ballads that recycle its tune decades later. One other important
                detail to emphasize in discussing the poem is that while Glover’s song is elegiac in
                tone, it actually celebrates Vernon’s victory and imperial expansion in the
                Caribbean and implicitly supports the trading interests of companies trafficking in
                enslaved bodies at that time. In this light, “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost” seems out of
                tune with the political message of the later antislavery ballads that echo its
                music. Discussing Cowper’s and More’s potential motivation for this awkward decision
                with students is a generative exercise. While the melancholy tone and maritime
                context certainly seem appropriate, the actual politics of Glover’s song—the zeal
                for the expansion of empire—seems dissonant with that of the antislavery lyrics. One
                explanation that may be offered is that the poets sought to reform the imperial
                economic impulse of Glover’s song by purging it of the moral stain of slavery and
                overwriting its voices with those of the disenfranchised.</p>
                        
            <p>Coming back to the question of voice can help students understand the real
                limitations of political sympathy in this context. Whose voice(s) do we hear in
                these poems, and why does it matter? The white noise we hear in antislavery ballads
                by Cowper and More is, after all, the spectral chorus of Glover’s song. It is likely
                that these poets chose Glover’s tune to strengthen sympathy for their enslaved
                African subjects. However, as Saidiya Hartman has proposed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scenes of Subjection</hi> (1997), sympathy in the literature of slavery and
                abolition can be as destructive a mechanism as it is humanizing. While we typically
                understand sympathy as our best means of human connection, it can often obliterate
                otherness in the process because it “fails to expand the space of the other and
                merely places the self in its stead” (20). The abolitionist project is often
                criticized for the ways in which the literature it produced whitewashed its enslaved
                African subjects, a transformation that seemed necessary for political reform at the
                time. Choosing Glover’s tune for their ballads, Cowper and More hoped to tap into a
                well of melancholy about the loss of English sailors during a major event in English
                imperial history. In doing so, they sought to facilitate as much sympathy as
                possible, but that mediation certainly comes at the cost of an authentic encounter
                with human otherness. To encounter otherness more directly would require a
                recognition of the limitations of sympathy, given our own national, racial, and
                gendered identity. It would also require an understanding of the limitations of the
                British abolitionist archive, which might be supplemented by West African or
                Caribbean texts that may have seemed alien to the British public—and particularly
                genres less mediated by abolitionist leaders, such as African music and song.</p>
                        
            <p>Another complication with respect to sympathy is the difference in situation between
                an encounter with one voice as opposed to many. While it seems natural to feel a
                more powerful sympathy for an individual, these sonically layered poems do in fact
                conjure a chorus of voices. Philip’s contemporary poetry collection <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong!</hi> develops this problem by refusing to construct
                individual voices altogether. Instead, her poems about slavery are fragments of
                voices rescued from the language of history and the law. White noise thus forms the
                polyphonic text of the <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> collection, allowing Philip to
                foreground the absence of enslaved voices in the archive while preserving the
                language of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>. Engaging these cacophonous
                and irrational poems, sympathy seems impossible and perhaps beside the point. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong!</hi> Philip transforms the noise in the law surrounding the
                horrific <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi> massacre into a kind of poetry whose aim is not
                to generate sympathy but to stage an ethical encounter with the victims of history
                that is as irrational as the event itself.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div type="section">
            <head>III. Listening for Noise in the Law</head>
                        
            <p>I ask my students to think about noise and formal haunting in a slightly different
                way when we turn to Philip’s <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> collection, which was
                inspired by a similar scene and situation. Both the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre and the deadly plague in Porto Bello featured in “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost”
                are tragic and melancholy episodes in British imperial history. However, Philip’s
                poetic approach to history is vastly different from that of Cowper and More. As an
                Afro-Canadian attorney as well as a poet, Philip’s shared interests in the history
                of transatlantic slavery and the law drew her to the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre. Philip’s project in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is to listen to the noise
                in the legal documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi> and to make that
                noise available to readers as poetic language. This involves mutilating the text of
                Lord Mansfield’s decision in that case and using it as a repository of language to
                reconstitute traces of the voices of the enslaved muzzled by the legal proceedings.
                While Mansfield famously expressed personal disgust with the institution of slavery,
                the conventions of the law prevented him from writing a decision that recognized the
                enslaved Africans in question as legal or political subjects. Part of Philip’s
                challenge in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi>, then, is to use that same language to
                attempt to give voice and reconstitute subjectivity, even if only in a fragmentary
                way.</p>
                        
            <p>Understanding that the task of mediating individual voices is impossible and perhaps
                ethically problematic, Philip allows testimony to come through as linguistic noise.
                We might say she is attempting to reconstruct historical subjectivity <hi
                    rend="italic">as noise</hi>. In “Notanda,” she explains her process and tracks
                her difficult journey making sense of the case. She begins with this statement:
                “There is no telling this story; it must be told” (189). What she means is that to
                render the story of the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi> in poetic narrative would be
                impossible because it absolutely resists narration. And yet, it must be told. The
                problem as Philip sees it is that the horrors of the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre resist logic and rationality, and no sense could possibly be made from a
                mere accounting of the details of the story or from listening to any one historical
                perspective. Her solution is to commit herself to the irrational because the event
                itself was irrational. Only by “not-telling,” then, can the story be told. The
                “not-telling” involves fragmenting the story told by the law and letting the noise
                in the legal archive come through <hi rend="italic">as noise</hi> instead of as
                potentially meaningful silence. Because Philip is not interested in a single voice
                or testimony (as Cowper and More are), I ask my students to consider what the
                fragmentation of language accomplishes that a ballad narrative cannot. Ultimately, I
                am interested in what kinds of justice, poetic or otherwise, emerge in each of these
                poems and what obstacles lie in the way of that justice.</p>
                        
            <p>Aside from assigning the first section of Philip’s collection, called “Os,” I also
                ask my students to read her essay “Notanda,” as well as Lord Mansfield’s brief
                decision in <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>, both of which are included at
                the end of Philip’s collection. The form that noise takes in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> is the violent disordering of legal language: “I murder the text,
                literally cut it into pieces, castrating verbs, suffocating adjectives, murdering
                nouns, throwing articles, prepositions, conjunctions overboard, jettisoning adverbs:
                . . . [I] create semantic mayhem,” she writes (193). The poems reconstructed from
                this mutilated language are spare and wild word arrangements on the page, liberated
                entirely from the restrictions of grammar and form. They can be read horizontally,
                vertically, and diagonally, either from top to bottom or the reverse. The thoughts
                and ideas that the word arrangements generate are not only specters of the
                transatlantic slave trade, they are also the dark matter of the law. If the law
                employs language to create order and meaning in the realm of human action, poetry
                can, Philip suggests, “engage language that is neither rational, logical,
                predictable, or ordered” (197). By subverting the legal language of
                <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert </hi>in an act of poetic
                violence, Philip conjures the shadows surrounding the <hi rend="italic">Zong</hi>
                massacre to access the human sounds obscured by the trial: “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> bears witness to the ‘resurfacing of the drowned and the oppressed’
                and transforms the desiccated legal report into a cacophony of voices—wails, cries,
                moans, and shouts that had earlier been banned from the text” (203). Unlike the
                singular voices constructed in the abolition ballads by Cowper and More, Philip’s
                voices are plural, fragmented, and just barely articulate. They do not tell a story
                as those ballads do; instead, they echo the senselessness of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> massacre in language that never really settles into a coherent
                account. Philip’s poems are thus fragments of voices that bubble up to the surface
                from the sea of history.</p>
                        
            <p>Because Philip’s poems begin from a place of abstraction, they pose many interpretive
                challenges for scholars and students alike. As spare word arrangements floating on
                the white page, Philip’s text encourages a kind of reading that breaks free from
                tradition. Instead of following a narrative thread, or even one channel of abstract
                thought along a single verse, the language of the poem surfaces at random as ideas,
                images, and concepts catch the reader’s attention. There is no order or story to
                discern in the poems—only fragments of voice and thought rescued from the
                restrictive legal documents of <hi rend="italic">Gregson v. Gilbert</hi>. While the
                poems are challenging in their abstraction, they also present teachers with a rich
                opportunity for conversation in the classroom. Breaking the class into small groups,
                each of which spends time with one poem, can be especially productive. The groups
                might spend ten or fifteen minutes lingering with one poem and taking notes.
                Students make a collective list of the words, phrases, statements, or ideas that
                come through the language on the page. Each group then considers and discusses what
                the poem wants the reader to receive. After the exercise, we come back together as a
                class and project each poem on the screen, one at a time, for everyone to see.
                Individual groups review their notes with the class and report on what the poem
                spoke to them.</p>
                        
            <p>Before each group reports back to the whole class, I like to revisit Philip’s journal
                entry from July 12, 2002, which she includes in “Notanda.” Reading this entry
                informs our understanding of the element of haunting involved in Philip’s process of
                composition, which complicates my students’ sense of poetic agency:

            This journal entry describes a conjuring. Philip’s process recalls a form of lyric
                possession described by Susan Stewart, but one that is markedly different as well.
                While the possession Stewart describes involves submitting one’s will to convention
                and to the irrationality of tune and meter, Philip is not plugging into the poetic
                tradition of the balladeer. She has a much more difficult task—to listen to the
                noise beyond the medium of the law for the voices silenced by the law, as if she
                were listening to voices under water. Philip burns incense, prepares herself for a
                visitation, and allows the words to “suggest how to work with them.” In listening
                for this kind of noise, Philip becomes a scribe for a story that can’t be told.
                Moreover, by submitting herself to ritual practice—burning incense—while listening
                to the British legal texts for the words to “leap out” at her, Philip’s process
                recalls the conjuring involved in obeah incantation. What makes this ritual unique,
                however, is its application of spiritual conjuring to the interpretation of British
                law. In this context, as an Afro-Canadian poet, Philip mediates the hauntological
                much like Cowper or More. It might be productive during this exercise to introduce
                Shepherd’s “The Negro Incantation,” which adopts the ode form to frame a Black obi
                voice, to underscore the radical significance of Philip’s approach. While Shepherd’s
                poem does capture the voice of Black colonial resistance, that voice is clearly
                bound by a white Western formal poetics. In Philip’s poems, however, Black voices
                are conjured and allowed to float freely on the page to make their own kind of
                noise, resisting the demands of a unified and coherent Western lyric subjectivity.
                This approach does justice to the historical denial of testimony by enslaved Black
                peoples in the discourse of the law while offering them a different kind of
                testimony, one that falls short of political voice but transcends legal silence.</p>
                        
            <p>What students may realize during their own reading experience is that it resembles
                Philip’s process of composition. That is, just as the words suggested their own
                arrangement to the poet, they also offer up bits of meaning in dynamic
                configurations in the process of reading. Moreover, students may observe that the
                poems do not only echo slave voices crying out but also offer up concepts from the
                legal texts that are up for critique or condemnation. Such configurations, when
                framed by the blinding whiteness of the page, arouse a horror that would be
                difficult to recognize if embedded in the original context. The work of making noise
                available to readers, Philip seems to suggest, sometimes involves dialing down the
                message of most of the original document(s) to make more audible those parts that we
                should linger on.</p>
                        
            <p>After each group presents their reflections to the class, I ask my students to
                critique Philip’s project and her creative/destructive dialogue between poetry and
                the law. I ask them what poetic justice means in a project like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong!</hi> Does it matter that there is no single voice, or testimony, or point
                of view? Does abstraction get in the way of the story that “can’t be told”? I also
                ask them to compare the kinds of justice achieved by Cowper and More in their
                antislavery ballads. Those poems are unified voices and narratives and communicate a
                message that is intelligible and digestible for readers. Moreover, they allow the
                reader to engage in (or at least perform) acts of sympathy with the speakers in the
                poems. At the same time, they feature other voices (the sailors in Glover’s song) by
                way of music—is sympathy possible there? Or is music so subliminal that it bypasses
                sympathy? The most important question to ask about <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> is
                whether sympathy is possible in such fragmented language. If sympathy can’t be
                generated, what is achieved by Philip? Whatever it is, is it more powerful than
                sympathy? If so, why?</p>
                        
            <p>One of the memorable classroom conversations that has emerged from this series of
                questions is one about the similarities between sympathy and haunting. If, as Adam
                Smith famously theorized, sympathy is a projective mechanism whereby we imagine
                ourselves in the place of the other, it is by its very nature a kind of possession.
                In Cowper’s and More’s poems, the performance of sympathy in connecting to the
                enslaved African experience may seem like haunting, but it may also be read as
                another form of colonization in which English sensibilities inhabit the bodies of
                others. At the same time, their use of Glover’s tune reminds us how unavoidably
                intertwined our histories are in a colonial narrative. In Philip’s project, however,
                haunting could never function as sympathy, for sympathy requires a coherent
                narrative or representation with which to identify. How do we connect to a story
                that can’t be told? The <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> poems facilitate a haunting in
                the reading experience that does not require the exchange of subjectivity we find in
                sympathy. We could never, after all, embody the experience of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> massacre. Instead of hearing voices or testimonies from the sea of
                history, we can only listen to noise. Being attentive to that noise offers us,
                according to Philip, a more expansive ethical relationship to our traumatic
                past.</p>

            <head>IV. Visual Noise</head>
                        
            <p>As a final exercise, one may introduce a group reflection devoted to visual noise by
                examining the political cartoon presented in Glover’s broadside alongside J. M. W.
                Turner’s famous painting <hi rend="italic">The Slave Ship</hi> (1840), which Ian
                Baucom considers at length in his landmark study, <hi rend="italic">Specters of the
                    Atlantic</hi> (2005). Both images capture melancholy scenes in Britain’s
                maritime history, and both are commentaries on empire. Moreover, they are both
                haunting seascapes that conjure the dead from below the water’s surface. Perhaps the
                most significant difference, however, is the representation of the dead. While
                Glover’s broadside gives clear individuality and outline to the spirits of the
                sailors who perished during Hosier’s blockade of Porto Bello, Turner’s drowned
                slaves dissolve in the sea. Pictorially, the slaves in Turner’s picture lack
                distinction, and the eye must strain to identify individual persons in the obscure
                detailing in the painting. Turner could have chosen to capture a scene of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zong</hi>’s slaves being thrown overboard, as his original title
                suggests, but he chose instead to eliminate identifiable human bodies from his work
                altogether. Human life is hauntingly signaled by red and orange color in the
                    water.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Baucom writes, “Turner . . . manages both to acknowledge the unevenness
                            of time, to admit the uncanny, repetitive presentness of the past within
                            the present, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to smooth time out, to contain
                            the massacre within ‘past’ time by appearing to enjoin a choice between
                            the past and an emergent, modernized present while indicating that there
                            really is no choice, only an occasion for disinterested sympathy and a
                            decent burial (of the dead, of the slave trade) that the living might
                            live on unhaunted by these specters of the Atlantic”

                    Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On</hi>), by J. M. W. Turner (1840). Museum of

            <p>What does it mean, one could ask the class, that the sailors of Hosier’s expedition
                receive individuality and voice as they address the victorious Admiral Vernon, who
                triumphantly captures Porto Bello with ships that proudly display the flag of
                Britannia? And what does it mean that in Turner’s painting the slaves thrown
                overboard become one with the sea in a horrifying, swelling tide of color and light?
                What is the power of Turner’s decision to abstract the human bodies in the water
                beyond recognition? After a conversation about this pictorial distinction, one could
                observe that these two images strikingly reflect the differences in representation
                we find between the abolition ballads by Cowper and More and Philip’s fragmented
                voices in <hi rend="italic">Zong!</hi> In the latter, there is no lyric voice or
                identity to be distinguished in the text, only traces of subjectivity floating on
                the page. Visually, Turner found abstraction to be appropriate for an event so
                lacking in humanity. Why is that? While a clear picture of the atrocity is
                unavailable to us in Turner’s painting, the vibrant fragments in the water certainly
                come through as an alarming form of noise.</p>

                <p>How, as teachers of the literature and history of slavery, are we to address the fact that

            <p>How, as teachers of the literature and history of slavery, are we to address the fact
                that our classrooms and campuses are still yet structured by the social relations of
                slavery? Using an Afropessimist framework that alerts us to the anti-Blackness of
                the American academy, in particular, and colonial modernity at large, this essay
                discusses teaching the literature of slavery and abolition as an exploration of “the
                pathology of Whiteness” and “the Slave grammar of suffering.” As it takes up texts
                by Mat Johnson, Edgar Allan Poe, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, and others, the
                essay moves toward a pedagogy of “dehiscence” that differentiates itself from

                selflessness alongside feelings of guilt, redemption, and consciousness-raising.</p>
                    
            
            <p>In the Spring semester of 2014, eighteen months prior to the course I describe in
                this essay, I had begun to study Afropessimism during a graduate seminar on global
                modernism. The following summer, when officers of the New York Police Department
                killed Eric Garner, when police officer Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown, when a
                highly militarized police force intensified its occupation of Ferguson, Missouri,
                Claudia Rankine published <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi> (2014), Black feminist
                activists founded the Movement for Black Lives, and Sandra Bland died in prison
                after her arrest following a pretextual traffic stop. Afropessimism offered an
                analytically rigorous and unflinching account of the paradigm of “ontological
                terror” (Warren) in which these events had occurred and a framework for reevaluating
                my fledgling pedagogical practices. Emerging in part from the acknowledgment of a
                continuum that links racial slavery to the anti-Blackness of contemporary Whiteness,
                policing, and state violence, Afropessimism challenges conventional accounts of
                civic reason and historical progress and produces a conceptual break to think
                through the paradigmatic anti-Blackness of global modernity in “the afterlife of
                slavery” (Hartman, <hi rend="italic">Lose Your Mother</hi> 6).</p>
                    
            <p>Afropessimism explains the performance of anti-Black racism in higher education as
                much as it explains the performance of anti-Black policing. As context for the
                discussion on pedagogy that follows, I will briefly describe a spate of anti-Black
                violence on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst that took place in
                the fall of 2014. Though I reproduce some of the language as it appeared on campus
                that fall, my purpose in doing so is not to transgress Black suffering but to refuse
                a practice so common to neoliberal institutionality by which systemic racism and
                structural violence are hushed in the service of a recommitment to the institution.
                At the time, the incidents I describe here led to the organization of somber events
                about “standing together against racism,” to sanctimonious acts of “reflection,” to
                repetitious commitments to “diversity and tolerance,” and to administrative calls to
                “work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect for all.”<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> An event called “Standing Together against
                        Racism: A Week of Reflection, a Day of Solidarity” was organized by the
                        Anti-Racism Committee of English Students and Faculty and featured a
                        full-day “Solidarity Read-In” that I participated in on November 4, 2014.
                        The phrase “work together to reaffirm our values of inclusion and respect
                        for all” appeared in a campus-wide email by the university’s chancellor,
                        Kumble Subbaswamy, on October 14, 2014.</note> There was little
                institutional recognition, however, of the well-documented history of anti-Black
                violence as a longstanding tenet of the academy at large, little space or outlet for
                the expression of Black anger, suffering, or rage, and no answer as to why incidents
                of anti-Black violence should lead the “community” to <hi rend="italic">come
                    together</hi> as opposed to <hi rend="italic">coming apart</hi>. Christina
                Sharpe comments on how often “the note of a more perfect union, the note of
                unhearable Black suffering” is struck by leaders on occasions of anti-Black
                violence: a striking note that “sutures Black suffering to romance and redemption”
                (par. 6). It is a practice far too common that seeks, by way of anti-Black
                institutions, solutions to the very problems they give rise to. I therefore describe
                these incidents in the spirit of an antiromantic and antiredemptive abolitionism in
                the service of an imperfect disunion.</p>
                    
            <p>In October 2014, amidst the cries and lamentations of protestors responding to the
                killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner that summer, anti-Black hate speech was
                found written on the door of a dorm room shared by two Black students in Harambee, a
                defined residential community for African and African American students. One of the
                students directly targeted, an undergraduate, had recently returned from Ferguson,
                where he had taken part in “Ferguson October,” a coalition-building social movement
                later known as “Ferguson Action.” It was written on his door during the fatefully
                named “Columbus Day” weekend (Odam). That same weekend, someone else had written
                explicit hate speech ostensibly targeting Mexican and multilingual Spanish-speaking
                students on the door of another dorm room, and the following week, several more
                students were targeted by a person later identified as Devin Ayres, who was charged
                with property damage and arraigned in the local district court, thereby leaving a
                public record of his “reasoning.” According to testimony quoted in reports, Ayres
                wrote “n*” on the door of one student because he knew her to be African American,
                while he wrote “you guys got nboyfriends” on the door of two White students because
                he knew one of them to be dating an African American man (Lederman, Vidales). Viewed
                through an Afropessimist lens, the performance of anti-Black sexual racism is
                neither aberrant nor anomalous but as banal and procedural as Ayres’s court
                testimony. In a university context, furthermore, the cop-out of White ignorance
                should not be allowed its ordinarily stabilizing effect for a multicultural society
                where education is purported to be the antidote to (rather than the cause of)
                anti-Black racism. There was nothing unknowing or unintentional about these acts of
                violence. Their intention, not to mention their effect, appears to have been to
                restore the order of White institutional dominance.</p>
                    
            <p>A year later, in the fall of 2015, I taught an introductory “Ethnic American
                Literature” course oriented toward transatlantic (anti)slavery literature. The
                course’s emphasis on the legacies of (anti)slavery literature engaged constructions
                of race, gender, and minoritization in narratives of slavery, colonialism,
                emancipation, and political awakening in a campus climate antagonized by anti-Black
                violence. Some of the texts, like Olaudah Equiano’s
                <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative </hi>(1789) and Edgar
                Allan Poe’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi> (1838), were drawn
                from the era of Romanticism, properly speaking, and animated our discussions of
                freedom, slavery, persuasion, and subjectivity. Most of them, however, were
                contemporary texts that take up Romantic-era concepts in a “speculative” framework,
                like Mat Johnson’s novel <hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>(2011),
                Celu Amberstone’s short story “Refugees” (2004), Octavia Butler’s
                <hi rend="italic">Bloodchild and Other Stories </hi>(1995/2005),
                and Samuel Delany’s novella
                <hi rend="italic">Empire Star </hi>(1966)—all texts that engage
                with race, racialization, and the rule of dominance in contemporary (anti)slavery.
                The course I was assigned to teach, “Ethnic American Literature,” is defined by the
                University of Massachusetts Amherst English Department as “American literature
                written by and about ethnic minorities, from the earliest immigrants through the
                cultural representations in modern American writing,” and the course is
                traditionally taught as an introduction to immigrant literature, focusing either on
                historical breadth or on a particular literary tradition (Jewish American literature
                or Asian American literature, for example). Because the department has no designated
                undergraduate course in Black studies, however, and because the course description
                itself implicitly excludes the forced migration of the transatlantic slave trade
                from the descriptive purview of the “ethnic,” I decided to create a version of the
                course that would reckon with the apparent unassimilability of racial slavery to the
                “immigrant” experience. Thus, two other themes drove my choice of the “sci-fi” texts
                on the syllabus, namely (time) travel and consciousness. More like an introductory
                (critical) ethnic studies or Black studies course than a survey of ethnic American
                literature, the course aimed to provoke commentary on race and (anti)slavery through
                Bildungsromans about characters who awaken to the realities of colonialism,
                conquest, and displacement.</p>
                    
            <p>In the initial course design, Afropessimism provided a framework for understanding
                the wave of anti-Black terror as a brief moment of disequilibrium in the hegemony of
                everyday violence held over from slavery, rather than some shocking set of events
                unrelated to the political structure of the academy. I wanted students to engage
                with this continuum, to question their assumptions about the “pastness” of slavery,
                the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism of the
                Obama administration. And I wanted them to <hi rend="italic">get mad</hi>, to feel
                authorized to <hi rend="italic">express anger</hi> about what was happening on
                campus—affects that, under the circumstances, I found preferable to “standing
                together” or tolerance, romance or redemption, or contrition or magnanimity. In the
                epigraphs above, Fred Moten speaks to a “dehiscence at the heart of the
                institution,” seizing on the ambiguity of that odd word to indicate how Black
                studies attends to the structural vulnerability of critical thought in the academy,
                where Black studies is furthermore constantly vulnerable to regulation, defunding,
                and marginalization. A (wound) dehiscence is an opening in a plant that allows seeds
                to disperse as well as a gaping incision in a body (politic) prone to infection. I
                did not at the time conceive of my pedagogy as a “dehiscent” one, but upon
                reflection, I see how teaching (in) the wounds of slavery pushed my class toward
                shared vulnerability rather than inviolable strength, and how this shifted the goals
                of student learning from individual mastery to “other motives,” namely humility,
                questioning, and (as Moten also notes) “selflessness” (<hi rend="italic">Universal
                    Machine</hi> 118).</p>
                    
            <p>As we moved from Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> to the text it annotates (Poe’s
                    <hi rend="italic">The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi>), the first half of
                the course addressed “the pathology of Whiteness,” a subject that animated a wide
                spectrum of student responses, ranging from sheer delight and selfless auto-critique
                to reactionary defensiveness and retrenched White supremacy. By producing a class
                that was vulnerable and conflicted, wounded and antagonistic, the prick and
                provocation of simply naming Whiteness led us into the second half of the course,
                which focused on “the Slave grammar of suffering,” a phrase I adopt from the work of
                Frank B. Wilderson III (<hi rend="italic">Red, White, and Black</hi> 28 and passim).
                As I will go on to explain, “the Slave grammar of suffering” disrupts fantasies of
                social wholeness and historical redress from the ontological vantage point of the
                slave, inducing disquiet and anger rather than sentimentality or saviorism. Seizing
                on the double meaning of “dehiscence” as diaspora and wound, the essay then
                concludes with some afterthoughts on pedagogy: what do students learn and unlearn
                when asked to sit with the collective and enduring traumas of slavery?</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, Mat Johnson’s third novel, follows protagonist Chris
                Jaynes, an assistant professor of African American literature, whose desire to
                uncover “how the pathology of Whiteness was constructed” (14) shapes his obsessive
                inquiry into the work of Edgar Allan Poe, particularly <hi rend="italic">The
                    Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</hi>, Poe’s Antarctic expedition
                tale. Chris is the only Black professor at a small liberal arts college in
                Manhattan, and as the only professor who specializes in African American literature,
                he is denied tenure because in teaching courses like “Dancing with the Darkies:
                Whiteness in the Literary Mind” (an allusion to Toni Morrison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Playing in the Dark: Whiteness in the Literary Imagination</hi> [1992]), he
                refuses to play the part of “Professional Negro” (7). “You were hired to teach
                African American literature,” explains the college president during a heated
                exchange. “Not just American literature. You fought that. Simple” (13).
                Foregrounding the racial politics of literary interpretation from the outset, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pym</hi> pits the institutional demand for minority representation
                (“We have a large literature faculty, they can handle the majority of literature.
                You were retained to purvey the minority perspective” [13]) against Chris’s heroic
                ambition to “[cure] America’s racial pathology,” which “like all diseases . . . had
                to be analyzed at a microscopic level” (8).</p>
                        
            <p><hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>staged a series of questions for us
                to consider at the outset of the course. Why does the college president say, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Not just</hi> American literature”? (emphasis added). Is African
                American literature (or ethnic American literature) <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                American literature, per se? And if the latter category is in fact so specific as to
                include these others, then why is it unmarked and unraced? Why not just refer to it
                as <hi rend="italic">White </hi>American literature? As the
                novel pursues such questions through a satirical travel narrative that takes Chris
                and an ad hoc “Creole crew” to Antarctica in search of the fabled island of Tsalal,
                that “great undiscovered African Diaspora homeland” referred to in Poe’s text
                (“uncorrupted by Whiteness”), it also begins to answer them (39). Whiteness is a
                “pathology and a mindset,” Chris thinks, not an “ethnic nomenclature” (33, 31). It
                is “metaphorical” (30), an “ideology” (30), and a “strategy” (31). Above all,
                “Whiteness isn’t about being something, it is about being no thing, nothing, an
                erasure” (225), a claim that is confirmed symbolically when Chris and his crew are
                enslaved by a “race” of culture-less “snow honkies” called Tekelians who rule the
                white, windswept landscape of the South Pole (160). When their captivity among the
                Tekelians appears to be inescapable, Chris’s uncle, Captain Booker Jaynes, tells
                him, “You can’t run from Whiteness. You have to stand and engage it” (209). For
                Chris, though, Whiteness is not something “to stand.” From New York to Antarctica,
                Whiteness is the inescapable background of his every movement.</p>
                        
            <p>To facilitate conversation between and among students, I assigned everyone to a small
                (three-to-four-person) online writing group where they submitted short essays and
                reading responses and provided each other with written feedback. In addition to my
                notes on in-class presentations that were also required of every student, this
                online record of the course is where I’ve drawn the direct quotations and
                paraphrased commentary that appear throughout this essay.</p>
                        
            <p>As painful as it is to see Chris denied tenure, students writing about <hi
                    rend="italic">Pym</hi> were decidedly more affected by his enslavement, and the
                gratuitous violence used by the Tekelians to maintain control over their captives,
                than by the institutional politics of race that led to his firing. One non-Black
                student of color wrote that they were saddened by the apparent “hopelessness” of the
                novel, which seemed to suggest that “no matter how hard they [the crew] try,
                whiteness cannot be escaped.” Yet several students, perhaps feeling uncomfortable
                sharing this viewpoint with the whole class so early in the semester, confided that
                they were refreshed by the novel’s reorientation of the “normal” routes of
                novelistic desire, as <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> made the sniveling, nail-biting,
                blubber-eating white Tekelians repulsive and the Black Creole crew attractive.
                Indeed, many students became more comfortable analyzing Whiteness while reading <hi
                    rend="italic">Pym</hi>; and after also reading Poe’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative
                    of Arthur Gordon Pym</hi>, one student concluded that Whiteness is an “idea of
                unity that, in the case of this novel and perhaps in reality, only succeeds in
                destroying [rather] than bringing together. It swallows only the ideas that
                perpetuate its image as salvation, purity, and goodness, and erases all that would
                tarnish its brilliant color.” However, the criticism of Whiteness engendered by
                these books also led to some reactionary defensiveness and White entrenchment. In a
                response essay submitted to one of the online writing groups, one student wrote that
                Chris’s reference to the indistinguishability of the Tekelians (“they all pretty
                much looked the same to me” [131]) was effectively a form of reverse racism. This
                was addressed and, I think, adequately corrected both in their peer group and in the
                classroom, where we explained that an observer who is enslaved, and who therefore
                has no material or discursive power, cannot be <hi rend="italic">racist</hi>, even
                if that same observer can be provocative. I shared Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s definition
                of racism as “the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and exploitation of
                group-differentiated vulnerabilities to premature death” (28), and we made this one
                of the running definitions of racism for the course as a whole.</p>
                        
            <p>The satirical tone and allegorical humor of <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> makes it an
                accessible index for critiquing Whiteness and engendering generous if sometimes
                painful (auto)critique. Having read it prior to Poe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narrative</hi>, and along with excerpts from Morrison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Playing in the Dark</hi>, students are presented with a persuasive case to
                study Whiteness as pathology, strategy, ideology. What is additionally generative
                about these texts is that although they are sometimes misrecognized as saying that
                “race” is a biological signifier, they also prompt students to think about the
                evaluative symbolism of “color.” Early on in <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, Chris
                comments on a passage of Poe’s novel where the narrator observes a river on the
                island of Tsalal “made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue;
                [whose] cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and
                imperfect in regard to neighboring veins” (29). Chris suggests that the description
                resembles the “racial fantasy” of Booker T. Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise,” a
                fantasy, in other words, of functional segregation (29). I taught Poe’s imagery as
                an anti-Black fantasy of (social) control over the distribution of color, however,
                pointing out that this fantasy is represented repeatedly in both novels.</p>
                        
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, for instance, Mahalia Mathis is the
                great-great-granddaughter of Poe’s “hybrid” character Dirk Peters. Although she
                appears to Chris to be phenotypically Black, Mathis refuses African heritage. She
                heads the Native American Ancestry Collective of Gary, Indiana (NAACG), a group that
                uses DNA testing to prove that their genes have “no kind of Africa”: “I got lots of
                Indian in me. I got Irish and I got a little French too. I got some German, or so
                I’m told. I even got a little Chinese in me, on my mother’s side. Matter of fact,
                I’m sure I got more bloods in me than I knows. But I do knows this: I ain’t got no
                kind of Africa in these bones” (49). This anti-Black fantasy, which plays itself out
                in the self-recognition of several “colors” ostensibly excluding “black,” also plays
                out in the color symbolism of Chris’s Antarctic expedition. After he and his best
                friend, Garth, escape their captivity among the Tekelians, they flee to an Antarctic
                BioDome owned by a painter, Thomas Karvel (a parody of Thomas Kinkade, a popular
                American artist who billed himself as “the Painter of Light”), who provides them
                shelter while they work a small plantation. True to his moniker, “the Master of
                Light” is a sovereign of <hi rend="italic">color</hi>, a monarch over a Disney-like
                “fantasy of Whiteness” marked by the manufactured monochromatic oversaturation of
                the BioDome, where the animals are too-white, the grass too-green, the river
                too-blue, but where nothing is black except Chris and Garth, the interlopers (185).
                Indeed, Chris complains to Garth that Karvel’s paintings never have Black people in
                them; even worse, he suspects that in Karvel’s work, “black people couldn’t exist,
                so thorough was its European romanticization” (184).</p>
                        
            <p>In “The Case of Blackness,” Fred Moten writes that “the cultural and political
                discourse on black pathology has been so pervasive that it could be said to
                constitute the background against which all representations of blacks, blackness, or
                (the color) black take place,” arguing in sum that “blackness has been associated
                with a certain sense of decay, even when that decay is invoked in the name of a
                certain (fetishization of) vitality” (177). As if throwing their hands up, one
                student recognized “the absurdity in our world’s thought process that anything, even
                things of the same nature such as mice and birds, can be separated and classified
                into greater and lesser categories just because of color.” But Johnson’s
                <hi rend="italic">Pym </hi>and Poe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narrative</hi> suggest a politics of chroma that goes beyond irrational
                absurdity. For if black is theoretically every color, and whiteness is theoretically
                no-color, <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi> suggests that “the pathology of Whiteness” lies
                precisely in this desire to master color itself. Whiteness is an ideology and a
                strategy because it is an operation that speciates every-color into veins of a river
                that do not “commingle,” turning inward into monochromatic oversaturation, dividing
                up into “ethnic” varieties of American literature. Blackness is the chromatic
                equivalent of refusing this violent speciation, and Whiteness is by definition
                antagonistic to such a politics.</p>

            <head>The Slave Grammar of Suffering</head>
                            
            <p>In the anti-Black environment in which my students and I moved our way through this
                course, I was not surprised that some students would perform their Whiteness through
                reactionary defensiveness and entrenched White supremacist logics. I was heartened,
                however, that for the most part the White and non-Black students of color in the
                course allied with the interest of their Black peers (which is to say, with
                Blackness) and committed themselves seriously to diagnosing “America’s racial
                pathology.” Questioning the basis of one’s relationship to Whiteness can produce
                existential crises that overflow what a normative classroom is able to hold, putting
                students in a position that may be analogous to the one occupied by the person who
                asked Frank Wilderson, in an online interview, what a White person could do to
                interpellate Afropessimism without succumbing to a form of reasoning that would lead
                them to suicide: “As a white person who feels bad about all my race does, what can I
                do to help besides killing myself?” Wilderson’s answer was swift and to the point.
                Rather than “kill yourself,” the questioner should get angry and “undo yourself.”
                Moreover, the questioner should develop “ways and means for your speech and action
                to be authorized by a Black/slave grammar of suffering rather than the grammar of
                suffering of subalterns.” Wilderson concluded the answer by remarking on the radical
                potential of the questioner’s “undoing”: “You are far more dangerous by being
                committed in this long, protracted struggle than you are or would be if you just
                check out” (Wilderson, “I Am Frank”). After the first half of the course focused on
                the pathology of Whiteness, the second half took up “the Slave grammar of
                suffering.”</p>
                            
            <p>What is the difference between the subaltern grammar of suffering and “the Slave
                grammar of suffering,” and what does it mean to be “authorized” by the latter? In
                    <hi rend="italic">Red, White, and Black</hi> (2010), Wilderson defines grammar
                as “the structure through which the labor of speech is possible,” arguing that
                scripts which view “social turmoil through the rubric of conflict (i.e., a rubric of
                problems that can be posed and conceptually solved)” (5) represent, on the one hand,
                a subaltern grammar of suffering in which grievances are submitted and solutions
                proposed to return aggrieved parties to a condition of prior wholeness. On the other
                hand, scripts that view social turmoil through a “rubric of antagonism (an
                irreconcilable struggle between entities, or positions, the resolution of which is
                not dialectical but entails the obliteration of one of the positions)” represent a
                “Slave grammar of suffering” that disrupts the dream of repair (5). One of the
                primary distinctions between a “Slave grammar of suffering” and a grammar of
                subaltern suffering concerns a text’s relationship to resolution. From the vantage
                point of the Slave, whose exclusion from civil society is fundamental to the freedom
                enjoyed by citizens (Wilderson’s terminology includes “Humans,” “Whites,” and
                “Settlers”), inclusion is a form of “obliteration.” Being authorized by “the Slave
                grammar of suffering” therefore begins with refusing the “prescriptive gesture” of
                reconciliation. For Wilderson, it continues (through Frantz Fanon via Aimé Césaire)
                with “the end of the world . . . the only thing . . . worth the effort of starting”
                (337).</p>
                            
            <p>As literary texts, Celu Amberstone’s “Refugees,” Octavia Butler’s “Amnesty” and
                “Bloodchild,” Samuel Delany’s <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi>, and Olaudah
                Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> are all available to
                interpretation through the grammar of suffering: “Refugees” through a
                colonizer/colonized dynamic on the fictional planet of Tallav’Wahir; “Amnesty” and
                “Bloodchild” through the lens of captivity on earth and on the Tlic planet
                (respectively); <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi> through its plot to emancipate
                the enslaved Lll; and the <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> through its
                autobiographical account of enslavement. Yet as a story about people relocated from
                a postapocalyptic earth, “Refugees” seems to engage the suffering of the colonized
                or the migrant subject struggling to reestablish the customs of their homeland; it
                does not engage “the Slave grammar of suffering,” since through “natal alienation”
                such resolution is ultimately unavailable to the Slave (Patterson 5). Similarly, by
                focusing on a human protagonist who translates between human beings and an
                extraterrestrial lifeform that has colonized earth, Butler’s “Amnesty” is more about
                structural adjustment and human de-exceptionalism than it is about slavery.
                “Bloodchild” certainly appears to be about slavery, and many students were certain
                it was; they were therefore puzzled that Butler herself disagreed (“It amazes me
                that some people have seen ‘Bloodchild’ as a story of slavery” [30]). However, as
                one student observed about the gender and reproductive politics of the story, Butler
                was probably right to call her narrative about the implantation of a male human
                named Gan with Tlic larvae a “love story,” rather than a slave narrative:
                
            <quote>It is interesting that in a society where women get pregnant and have children all
                the time, it is often called love, but when it is a man being impregnated in almost
                the same exact way, it can be seen as slavery. Perhaps this happens because sci-fi
                novels are seen as so drastically different in their own imagined worlds that it is
                hard to see their similarity to the reality of life on Earth, or it is because of
                the patriarchal views that have been instilled in the reader that affect how
                “Bloodchild” is read.</quote>
                
            Prompted by such articulate student writing, I wonder, then, when I thought I was
                teaching about slavery several years ago, if I was not, perhaps, teaching about
                something else. Recognizing that not all of these texts are engaged with the grammar
                of Slave suffering places pressure on how I would teach Romantic antislavery
                literature and its legacies in the future, especially when the topic is “the slave
                narrative.”</p>
                            
            <p>Of all the texts we read together, Delany’s
                <hi rend="italic">Empire Star </hi>gets nearest to representing
                the suffering of the Slave, as it were, grammatically. At the center of this novella
                about slavery and emancipation in a far-off galaxy is “the suffering of the Lll”
                (79), a race of world-building beings whose emancipation is seemingly dependent on
                the delivery of a message to Empire Star by the young protagonist, Comet Jo. As
                students begin to notice, however, the Lll never speak. They are always described
                collectively, never individually. And their enslavement seems to be constituted as
                much by their silence as through the garrulous verbosity of everyone else with
                something to say about why the Lll should be or should not be emancipated, which is
                to say, every other “free” character. “Their place in the book is the un-speaking
                point of conflict,” wrote one student; indeed, “they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
                conflict, not <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">being</hi>.
                And while they might achieve ‘emancipation,’ they are not free, but remain enslaved
                to others with a voice.” The world of <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi> clearly
                depends upon the slavery of the Lll, making their emancipation a political farce and
                their suffering an antagonism with no redress—pessimistic conclusions frankly
                confirmed by <hi rend="italic">Empire Star</hi>’s circular, spiral, and
                “retrocausal” form (Shephard). Treating the continuum of slavery and emancipation as
                a formal element of the text, the novella ends exactly where it began, with Comet Jo
                realizing he has been tasked with Lll emancipation perhaps many times before.</p>
                            
            <p>By contrast, Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> appears to end on
                a somewhat hopeful, solution-oriented note based on free-market liberalism, the
                British state’s capacity for “justice,” and the good will of “every man of
                sentiment” (176). Yet if this prescriptive gesture lends itself to an interpretation
                as a grammar of suffering from a subaltern rather than Slave perspective, the book
                is nevertheless undoubtedly a narrative that grapples with exposing the grammar, or
                structure, of Slave suffering. In one class discussion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Interesting Narrative</hi>, a conversation that continued in our online
                discussion forum, I introduced students to the evidence compiled by Vincent Carretta
                suggesting that Equiano may have been born in Carolina, even though his
                autobiography tells us he was born in Africa, was captured as a child, and suffered
                the Middle Passage (see also Youngquist). I explained that Carretta’s evidence
                included the ship’s log for Equiano’s Arctic voyage as well as the record of his
                baptism, both of which identified Carolina as his place of birth. I also explained
                that Carretta’s intent was not to cast doubt on Equiano’s narrative but to raise
                questions about what literary and political concerns may have motivated Equiano’s
                fabrication, if it were indeed true. Why would Equiano invent a first-person fiction
                in the midst of a true autobiography?</p>
                            
            <p>The conversation that ensued more or less followed Carretta’s own conclusions:
                Equiano’s political motivation was to abolish slavery, and an account that included
                a young child being captured and enduring the Middle Passage was the most likely way
                to provoke what one non-Black student referred to as a “drama-driven English
                audience.” Elaborating on a now-foundational connection between the liberal
                antislavery movement and spectacular representations of Black suffering (Hartman,
                    <hi rend="italic">Scenes of Subjection</hi>), some students were therefore
                content to understand autobiography as a genre with certain formal needs and
                capabilities, including “literary devices.” Abolition by any means necessary. Others
                went so far as to suggest that it was “natural and unavoidable to lie when selling a
                story,” and that the act of lying “is practically part of the social contract”
                between writers and readers.</p>
                            
            <p>This conversation was enormously productive for changing the mind of at least one
                non-Black student, who wrote online that before the full unfolding of our class
                discussion he viewed Equiano’s potential fabrication as a way to disguise his status
                as an otherwise “privileged slave” who was able to read, write, and build
                relationships with free Whites. “I thought that it seemed a bit ridiculous that he
                would make things up and make [a narrative of his capture and the Middle Passage]
                sound like his own life to rouse sympathy in the readers,” wrote the student, whose
                classmates were quick to jump on the notion of “privilege” at play. One non-Black
                peer wrote that they would “hesitate to call a slave privileged, especially since it
                is clear from the text that Equiano does not define himself this way and
                consistently refers to any good luck that comes his way as an aberration from a
                system that is built to deny him any good fortune. He certainly considers himself
                blessed, mainly in retrospect after being freed, but his narrative is demonstrating
                how the institution of slavery blocks privilege based on race.” A good
                point—although it was ultimately not the purpose of the first student to pursue the
                idea of “privilege.” Rather, in examining why Equiano would fabricate aspects of his
                autobiography, the student had become interested in whether it was Equiano’s
                intention “to voice stories of other slaves that do not have the opportunity to.” In
                other words, was Equiano’s narrative more of a social history than an
                autobiography?</p>
                            
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Intimacies of Four Continents</hi> (2015), Lisa Lowe
                demonstrates how Equiano’s narrative, given voice through a genre of liberalism (“In
                a sense, the autobiography is the liberal genre par excellence” [46]), reveals a
                connection between slavery, subjugation, and “the singular life” (71). In thinking
                of the <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> as a kind of polyvocal
                performance of himself and “other slaves,” then, my student was perhaps moving
                toward a critique of autobiography: Olaudah Equiano was not only Equiano, he was
                also Gustavus Vassa, and he was born in multiple places. In attempting to find a
                grammar requisite to the suffering of the Slave, Equiano/Vassa had to call the genre
                of the autobiography, the narrative of the singular life, into profound question.
                Even though the
                <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative </hi>concludes with a
                predictable form of prescriptive redress, much of it nevertheless strives toward a
                “Slave grammar of suffering” that is collective and dispersed rather than selfish,
                self-made, or individual. The internal differentiation of Equiano’s narrative into
                that of Gustavus Vassa
                <hi rend="italic">as well as </hi>“[those] slaves that do not
                have the opportunity” leads us to think and imagine antislavery everywhere.</p>

                        <head>Toward a Pedagogy of Dehiscence</head>
                        
            <p>In recent years, the field of Black studies has become, perhaps more consciously than
                ever before, an interdisciplinary mode, a fugitive method, and an intellectual
                itinerary variously referred to as <hi rend="italic">black study</hi>,
                <hi rend="italic">black </hi>study<hi rend="italic">, and </hi>black
                    <hi rend="italic">studies</hi>, which are inseparable but nevertheless
                distinguishable from the disciplinary study of blackness, Black people, or Black
                arts and culture. While there are many descriptions of what black study is and does,
                Moten’s description of it as “a dehiscence at the heart of the institution and at
                its edge” (“Black Op” 1743) has animated these afterthoughts on the pedagogy of
                dehiscence in and as a form of wounding that is also a plan of dispersal. Dehiscence
                is a recurring concept in Moten’s work, where he mobilizes uses of the phrase from
                Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Lacan with a difference—as in the
                second epigraph, from an essay on Adrian Piper, where he further elaborates on
                dehiscence as a “motif of selflessness” against the longstanding association of
                subjectivity with the inviolability of the possessive individual
                (<hi rend="italic">Universal Machine </hi>118). My
                understanding of dehiscence as a marginal if animating premise and practice of Black
                studies postdates the “Ethnic American Literature” course I have described. However,
                in our attention to “the Slave grammar of suffering” expressed in course materials,
                in society in general, and on the UMass Amherst campus circa 2014/15 in particular,
                we were, I think, working toward a pedagogy of dehiscence—a learning environment
                that takes place in the vulnus or wound of slavery thought to have been closed by
                emancipation, reconstruction, and civil rights.</p>
                        
            <p>My use of the word dehiscence to describe a method of teaching (anti)slavery
                literature and its legacies thus weaves together Black studies pedagogy with the
                intellectual and scholarly protocols of Afropessimism, which repeatedly express
                dissatisfaction with the state of academic knowledge production as civic engagement,
                politically acceptable modes of reform, and solution-oriented prescriptive gestures
                for addressing the continuum of anti-Black violence. In the introductory “Ethnic
                American Literature” course that I have described, it was difficult to address “the
                pathology of Whiteness” and “the Slave grammar of suffering” in part because
                students accustomed through education to think of themselves as becoming productive
                individuals, engaged citizens, and masters of solutions in a context driven by
                competition against one another are not accustomed to “undoing” aspects of their
                education rather than advancing their careers. There is nothing that excludes
                radical forms of care and compassion from a classroom informed by these practices.
                However, the feelings of woundedness and vulnerability in my class did not
                immediately lend themselves, nor should they have, to being neatly, cleanly
                sutured.</p>
                        
            <p>In a well-known passage of <hi rend="italic">Teaching to Transgress: Education as the
                    Practice of Freedom</hi> (1994), bell hooks shares an anecdote about the pain
                her students feel when they take her classes: “We take your class. We learn to look
                at the world from a critical standpoint, one that considers race, sex, and class.
                And we can’t enjoy life anymore” (42). hooks concludes the passage by suggesting
                that modeling mutual respect for that pain reveals its commonness among students
                “across race, sexual preference, and ethnicity,” and she writes that through sharing
                this pain her classes “build community” (42–3). In the “Ethnic American Literature”
                course I taught, students experienced similar feelings of pain, confusion, remorse,
                anger, and defensiveness when sitting with the violence of Whiteness and the
                enduring suffering of slavery’s afterlives, and though I do not wish to disagree
                with hooks’s optimistic comments about community-building, I do wish to question
                them. To my mind, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not (at least not at first) end in a
                reformed community. Instead, in ways much more congruent with recent literature in
                abolitionist pedagogy (Dunn, Love, Rodriguez, Whynacht), it opens up the possibility
                of ending “community.” Put another way, a pedagogy of dehiscence does not seek
                simply to undermine the hierarchical relations of the classroom and build community
                on disingenuous assertions of equality in the afterlife of slavery. Rather, a
                pedagogy of dehiscence acknowledges that the classroom continues to be structured by
                the social relations of conquest, colonialism, and slavery, and accepts that the
                wound this creates ought to cause one (one? many? who? us?) to pursue the
                abolitionist endeavor of ending <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind of world. Wherever
                that endless struggle takes us, that’s where we start.</p>

                    narratives within contextual materials; the triangulation of literary interpretation with historical and current interpretive concepts 
                    and methods; the triangulation of Atlantic coasts and land entities; and the triangulation of the strategic terms “fluidity,” “circulation,” 
                    and “movement” borrowed from nonliterary fields of study. Effectively, an Atlantic approach has the depth and breadth to put history, economic 
                    trade, political movements, and maritime realities in relation to rhetorical and figurative analysis of literary texts. </p>

            <p>Romantic period studies has tended to focus on those literary and cultural concerns
                that apply to Anglo-American relations in terms of a transatlanticism belonging to a
                determinate timeframe. However, the Romantic period was an age of global capitalism,
                plundered resources, and cross-contamination; therefore, enlarging the
                Anglo-American dialogue of public voices and efficacious texts more expansively
                makes sense, as Bernard Bailyn and Joselyn M. Almeida have argued in separate
                contexts. Although I will be focusing here on the triangular relation of Africa,
                Britain, and British holdings in the Caribbean, folding into that relation the
                French colony of Saint Domingue and the American city Philadelphia for two of the
                texts discussed, the same argument for expanding the field of analysis holds for
                colonizers, the colonized, and brutalized or enslaved peoples of other territories
                within panatlantic land masses. The point of engaging with these histories, the
                ideologies that produced them, and the testimonies of survivors is that the concerns
                of the Atlantic world remain central to the concerns of today’s Atlantic and global
                reality. Historically, too, a more expansive treatment of the Romantic-era Atlantic
                world could put the trading circuits of the West Indies and the East Indies in
                dialogue; or one might make the connection for students between the working of West
                Indian plantations and the not-too-different circumstances of the diamond mines
                today in mineral-rich countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nations
                whose people see no profit from the rapacious mining of their land by others. In
                terms of the transatlantic, this more expanded perspective is the interdisciplinary
                domain of Atlantic World studies, which involves a deep sense of history from plate
                changes in the ocean’s bottom to human geography (which, for example, examines
                migration patterns over centuries, death tolls among enslaved people, and movement
                between Caribbean islands and plantations).<note

            <p>The dilemma of what can be crammed into a class discussion arises when the materials
                concerning the sites of literary production and dissemination (important for
                emphasizing the precarity of narratives and testimonials of enslaved peoples) can be
                enriched through contextualizing documents, such as those of charity organizations
                or Parliamentary records of abolitionist and other conservative documents. Yet I
                want to argue instead for a more engaged Atlanticist lens to broaden how we situate
                and affirm the complexities of Atlantic life for students, the malleable nature of
                Atlantic identity, and its opportunities for self-reinvention.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I also want
                            to caution against restricting ourselves to the British imperial when
                            teaching the Romantic period: the Black Atlantic intersects with the Red
                            Atlantic (the circulation, exchanges, and material productions of
                            indigenous peoples in the Atlantic and coastal regions of the Americas,
                            as well as their travels to Britain, Europe, and Africa), and the
                            Hispanic and Lusophone Atlantic world whose historical importance loomed
                            large in the period, as well as the Francophone Atlantic, all of which
                            extend our teaching about British Empire through these other
                            circulations and imperial networks.</note> To think
                pedagogically using such a lens has allowed me to think more broadly geographically
                and temporally in order to situate the revolutionary aspects of Atlantic life in the
                Romantic period. My main strategy is one I adapted from the nautical strategy of
                triangulation to teach literary interpretation of narratives and testimonials of
                enslaved persons, historical texts or information, related texts and websites in
                groups of three, and to apply Atlantic studies concepts and methods in connection
                with literary analysis. The strategy of triangulation has been richly explored in
                the work of Bailyn, Jeremy Smith, Almeida, Rebecca Cole Heinowitz, and others.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See also

                Anglo-American oppositional model, triangulation is not just adding a middle term to
                create a dialectical engagement; rather, it involves the fluid movement of dynamic
                relationality among multiple and variable subjects. In this way texts can be
                revisited several times to re-see them, and the strategic terms “fluidity,”
                “circulation,” and “movement” help students approach the revisiting as necessary and
                deepening rather than repetitive. This strategy has helped me unpack with my
                students a vitally mobile and contingent arena in which texts embodying this dynamic
                can be read against those stemming from empire, against each other, and within a
                network of unstable conditions and circumstances.<note

            <p>Moreover, broadening the historical horizon from an Atlantic World perspective allows
                students to view the slave trade, abolition, and radical politics during the
                Romantic period as conversant with our contemporary politics. The courageous voices
                of those enslaved during the Romantic period take on a new legitimacy for my most
                recent students, compared with the way earlier student cohorts had responded to such
                texts; current students can more readily hear and empathize with the outrage of
                those from so long ago. This outrage responds to the authority of lived experience.
                While students understand that the value of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> singular
                life made clear in individually voiced accounts was politically important to the
                abolitionist cause, the personal and communal resilience that such accounts express
                was necessary then and comes across all these many years later to be heard in all
                its dignity. These voices, then, can be further complicated (rather than polarizing
                them against the claims of colonists and politicians) with the biographies of
                figures like Baron de Vastey, who Marlene Daut has argued was signal for the
                development of a “[B]lack Atlantic humanism.” In counterpoint to Toussaint
                L’Ouverture’s rhetorical promotion of brotherhood across color lines, Vastey, a
                Haitian of biracial descent and Toussaint’s contemporary, critiques colonial
                dependencies on slavery. The slave trade and the high morbidity of slave labor,
                Vastey unceasingly argued, reveals that a free-market economy is merely an
                ideological justification for the inexcusability of racism.</p>
                
            <p>Using material like Daut’s <hi rend="italic">Baron de Vastey and The Origins of Black
                    Atlantic Humanism</hi> (2017) to set the triangle trade within cosmopolitan
                humanism, as well as other globalizing contextual materials (the competition between
                goods produced in the East Indies and the West Indies, for instance), expands the
                horizon of how we teach the transatlantic and the Atlantic world, but only if those
                singular voices are heard as integrated with larger contexts. Accounts of formerly
                enslaved persons are important for our students because, although mediated for a
                white audience, they make disclosures about lived experience that novels can only
                gesture to, especially for those students who resist the empathy necessarily
                involved in reading actual accounts, and worse, the documentation of abusive planter
                    practices.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            See Thomas’s excellent <hi rend="italic">Romanticism and Slave
                                Narratives</hi> (2000), which has greatly helped me in teaching
                            Black British writing, as well as Aljoe’s <hi rend="italic">Creole
                                Testimonies</hi> (2012), which distinguishes between the testimonial
                            and the narrative in terms of authorial voice and rhetorical strategy.
                            More recently, Chander and Matthew’s “Abolitionist Interruptions” has
                            extended how to think about slave narrative and about antislavery
                            literature as a genre.</note> While I rely on the arguments of
                Mark Salber Phillips for understanding historical distance through the narrative
                function, that gut-level pain is also interpretatively valid. To make connections
                between textual accounts in a way that makes for meaningful interpretation, I have
                found that starting with an emotionally rather than physically painful event can
                translate what students may be feeling into something we can discuss and then extend
                to other connections between the texts that are more politicized, and therefore more
                rhetorically inflected.</p>
                
            <p>For instance, in my recent course offering, I asked students to look at a similar
                event in Mary Prince’s and Olaudah Equiano’s narratives, and then to contrast it
                with Toussaint’s experience.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I found Todorova’s essay on Prince and Boulukos’s
                            and Mallipeddi’s essays on Equiano extremely helpful for triangulating
                            these texts for students.</note> Prince’s account of the end of
                childhood, when her mistress sends her to work at another house, is charged with the
                distress of the twelve-year-old girl; but the moment when her mother has to take her
                and her sisters to the slave market to be sold after the death of her mistress,
                despite the distance of years at the time of writing, is suffused with emotional
                pain at confronting this final separation from family and home. Beginning with the
                day before, she writes: “Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,—it is too
                much.—It recalls the great grief that filled my heart, and the woeful thoughts that
                passed to and fro through my mind, whilst listening to the pitiful words of my poor
                mother, weeping for the loss of her children” (3). In describing the next morning,
                Prince uses funereal language to depict the emotional death she and her mother feel
                at this moment: “The black morning at length came. . . . Whilst she was putting on
                us the new osnaburgs in which we were to be sold, she said, in a sorrowful voice, (I
                shall never forget it!) ‘See, I am
                <hi rend="italic">shrouding </hi>my poor children; what a task
                for a mother!’” (3). This chilling moment, in which the mother has to sell her own
                children at the slave market, is heartrending in itself, while Prince’s use of
                language and word choice feels authentic rather than rhetorically distant (“I shall
                never forget it!”); the imagery of a funeral rather than a marketplace symbolizes
                the death of the subject-self that being sold is meant to create. But the
                exclamations and the never-forgotten emotion reveal, just as surely, that Prince has
                held on to her subjectivity in a way that students can now see is revealed
                throughout her narrative; Prince is a strong woman, one who can advocate through her
                story, and so provide a heroic model of fortitude in the face of extreme
                suffering.</p>
                
            <p>Equiano has a similar and compelling story to tell about the rending of a family.
                Although his begins with his sister’s and his abduction by African “slavers,” his
                parents never to be seen again, their strong sibling bond sustains them until the
                fatal moment when they are broken apart.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> “Slavers” was the term commonly used in
                            the period for those engaged in capturing or gathering individuals for
                            selling to others.</note> I ask students to closely examine the
                two scenes, Prince’s and Equiano’s, to compare the affective impact of their uses of
                rhetoric.</p>
                
            <p>One day . . . I saw one of those people come into the yard of our next neighbour but
                one, to kidnap, there being many stout young people in it. Immediately on this I
                gave the alarm. . . . But alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus attacked, and to
                be carried off, when none of the grown people were nigh. . . . But alas! we were
                soon deprived of even the small comfort of weeping together. . . . [F]or my sister
                and I were then separated, while we lay clasped in each other’s arms. (62)</p>
                
            <p>Rhetorically, the “But, alas!” repetition has a lot of work to do, but for a modern
                reader, it can’t carry the weight of the experienced trauma in the way that Prince’s
                “Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,—it is too much.—” still does. If
                Equiano’s response to the loss of his sister is different from Prince’s and perhaps
                strikes the reader as pathos-filled rather than grief-stricken—so that students try
                to locate the difference in experienced pain contextually—I’ve found it helpful to
                shift their attention to seeing that the way the story is told can change the
                emotional register, and that the way emotion is being put to use should not
                influence us to value or devalue one person’s pain over another’s, given our
                historical biases. Critical context thus informs students’ understanding of the
                disruptive force of the Atlantic trade during this period and the valuation of
                bodies in a marketplace that took no account of pain.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The Portuguese created a
                            slave-trade category for the standard measure in valuing Black lives,
                            the “pieza” (“piece”). Drawing on C. L. R. James’s research, Wynter
                            explains that a pieza “was a man of twenty-five years, approximately, in
                            good health, calculated to give a certain amount of physical labor. He
                            served as the general equivalent of physical labor value against which
                            all the others could be measure—with for example, three teenagers
                            equaling one pieza and older men and women thrown in a job lot as
                            refuse” (Wynter 81, as cited by Mignolo, 114).</note> Equiano
                openly states that his own father owned enslaved people, a repugnant fact for many
                students; he also explains the practice of African enslavers in terms of kidnapping
                and domestic servitude and in opposition to the brutality of the triangle slave
                trade. This sometimes leads students to dismiss Equiano’s narrative. But by getting
                students to look for resemblance rather than difference, they can then see that like
                Prince, Equiano also tries to find a sense of home when he is with kinder people,
                and yet whereas she finds her real sense of “home” in her own strong sense of self,
                he continually remakes himself, transforming himself fluidly through the
                circulations of ship voyages he participates in. He makes himself into an Atlantic
                identity, so that he’s at home everywhere—on shipboard, in Philadelphia, in London,
                and so on—whereas we sense that Prince is never at home except within herself. And
                his rhetorical style is not just due to the temporal distance between the act of
                writing and biographical events; Equiano is becalmed as he writes his narrative,
                stilled by the land he now inhabits and the perhaps unyielding political audience he
                addresses.</p>
                
            <p>In his <hi rend="italic">The Black Jacobins</hi> (1938), which tells the history of
                St. Domingue and Toussaint L’Ouverture’s extraordinary transformation of the colony
                into a free state by 1803, C. L. R. James refuses the fiction of historical
                objectivity; students immediately respond to his passionate engagement with his
                story and his protagonist, and the book is filled with his exclamatory asides.
                Toussaint suffers none of the rending of family that Prince and Equiano experience,
                and so James’s indignation is focused on the abuses endemic to slavery and those
                historians who had covered it over. “A venal race of scholars, profiteering panders
                to national vanity, have conspired to obscure the truth about abolition,” he rails
                (51). By contrast, Toussaint “was so genuinely kind to the whites in their
                distressful condition that they could not fail to appreciate it” (157). James cannot
                but revel in the man’s political acuity and gracious use of political speech acts
                and his tolerance as a political leader for everyone in St. Domingue; his voice and
                message are clear in quotations from letters and speeches: “Learn, citizens, to
                appreciate the glory of your new political status. In acquiring the rights that the
                Constitution accords to all Frenchmen, do not forget the duties it imposes on you.
                Be but virtuous and you will be French men and good citizens. . . . Work together
                for the prosperity of San Domingo . . . [to] assure public well-being” (205). I
                point out to students how this passage, and Toussaint’s worry over “the fate of some
                unhappy whites who have been victims in this business” (157), is in stark contrast
                to James’s own assessment of white treatment of Blacks: “The difficulty was that
                though one could trap them like animals, . . . and beat both [man and animal] with
                the same stick, . . . they remained, despite their black skins and curly hair, quite
                invincibly human beings” (11).</p>
                
            <p>To situate James’s passionate history, I ask students to read Sylvia Wynter’s article
                on James, “Beyond the Categories of the Master Conception,” which clarifies her own
                theoretical adaptation of James’s Afro-Caribbean-based theory of capitalism as a
                colonial-based rather than a trade-based economy, one requiring enslaved labor
                rather than wage labor. The bourgeois development of capitalism that overthrew a
                monarchy-based economy depended on the development of a colonial scheme built on
                unpaid labor from colonists, indentured servants, and enslaved persons. The
                monarchial symbolics of blood (blood lineage, vassalage, war), as Wynter explains,
                was replaced by a symbolics of skin color, the effects of which still reverberate
                today. Wynter posits the human condition of “becoming [B]lack” to explain the way
                that discourse co-produces social experience along with colonial capitalism for
                anyone who, we could say, has not undergone “becoming white.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Mignolo (116). “Becoming white” is my addition so that
                        students understand the concept of race as a discursive
                    formation.</note> Discourse produces the knowledge that one is becoming
                Black in a repetition of experience that daily announces this condition, whether the
                year is 1800 or 2024.</p>
                
            <p>For students, then, firsthand accounts put the entire phenomenon of the slave trade
                into perspective, and for some students of color, especially those who are African,
                African American, or Caribbean American, firsthand accounts can be empowering, while
                secondhand accounts like James’s can reinforce that self-empowerment. These
                firsthand narratives give students a sense of what self-determining voices like
                Prince’s, Equiano’s, and Toussaint’s sounded like. The inner strength and the
                courage to simply live a life, or to trade up one’s own life-value, or to liberate a
                people, comes through in these narratives. Romantic literature gains a special
                meaning for these students, one that speaks to them in today’s contexts; it can also
                give them a history of strength, endurance, and courage. Texts from the more recent
                past, such as James’s, and from today’s headlines or popular genres add resonance to
                making personal connections with such a history. Identifying with texts from a
                different time and culture has resulted in multiple end-of-the-semester research
                papers on Equiano and women’s slave testimonials, as well as a comparative treatment
                of women’s escape narratives in the period. Recently a student has also used
                information from short lectures I gave on the slavery and human trafficking
                practices at this time on the Barbary Coast and in the Ottoman Empire to develop a
                paper on Equiano that sets him in a wider context of slaver practices historically
                and within the period.</p>
                
            <p>In using an Atlanticist lens to teach this material, I try to return our focus to the
                networks of colonialism wherever this approach makes sense, because more was at
                stake in the triangle slave trade than the economy of bodies. The forward trajectory
                of the larger stakes surely begins with the population decimation of northwestern
                Africa and the overpopulation of the West Indies, but they include the monoculture
                practices of Caribbean plantations (and continuing today with Caribbean banana
                plantations, for instance), which—concurrently with the rise in Western national
                gross products—also changed the natural resource structure of Caribbean terrain.
                Through increased commerce in peoples, animals, plants, and goods, the slave trade
                also grossly heightened the effects and pace of anthropocenic change, giving
                students a sense of how disastrous history can affect worlds as well as peoples.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Carney

            <p>But the textual analysis I’ve been putting forth still does not suggest the economy
                of movement that Atlantic life involves, and metaphor is a helpful intervention
                here, specifically the chronotope of the ship.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> This is the chronotope that Gilroy,
                            following Bakhtin, explicitly calls attention to in <hi rend="italic"
                                >The Black Atlantic</hi> (1993) (17).</note> That the ship
                should also be understood literally through viewing the virtual slave ship on the
                SlaveVoyages.org website gives the metaphor powerful resonance in its suggestion of
                mobility and flexible use. To image fluidity, movement (a term encompassing more
                than human mobility and displacement), and circulation of the Atlantic world, the
                metaphor of the Atlantic-ranging ship is perhaps unsurpassed. Whereas both fluidity
                and circulation take into account the stagnation of being becalmed, Equiano’s
                autobiography underscores how thriving among aquatic conditions requires
                understanding oneself, or at least one’s life, in terms of the vessel that sails
                such waters. Living in and on the Atlantic waterways requires at the very least
                having an abiding interest in shipping news and port landings; in order to flourish,
                however, of more value would be possessing a working knowledge of the vessel and,
                indeed, the classificatory terminology used for distinguishing vessels and their
                component parts. These, as Equiano’s life story reflects, were key not just to ship
                life but also to life itself: ship life <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, in a sense,
                Atlantic life. And learning to navigate—as Equiano does—requires a more flexible
                thinking, one based on a triangulating impulse that can reconcile oppositions
                through adjacencies and affiliations.</p>
                
            <p>Triangulation—not just the juxtaposition of three terms but the fluid and dynamic
                movement between them—is key, I argue, to teaching Romanticism in terms of Atlantic
                movement, whether we are working with the binaries of the Anglo-American
                transatlantic or with the multiple triangulations of the Caribbean islands and
                Atlantic littoral that are always in play or potentially so. Putting the Atlantic
                ship metaphor and triangulation together, we might consider what the triangle slave
                trade has culturally produced as our heritage, the disturbed flow of water and lives
                that Christina Sharpe argues in <hi rend="italic">In the Wake: On Blackness and
                    Being</hi> (2016) is demonstrably ongoing. The “wake” figures a disruptive
                dimension in the lives of African Americans that began with a cut across what had
                been, the ship cutting across the ocean’s own waves as it cuts into lives, cuts off
                lives, and changes human relations in monstrous ways. In this sense, the United
                States is in relation not only to Britain and the West African coast but also in
                relation to the ocean and its human footprint on land, an ongoing relation of
                turmoil. Understanding the West’s impact on the West Indies during this period gives
                students a way to place Romanticism within their twenty-first-century perspective,
                not only as a chapter in the difficult history of enslavement but also as part of an
                aspirational identity, of a heroism born of struggle that is evidenced in the
                narratives of formerly enslaved persons, where singular voices, accounts of
                uprisings and attempted uprisings, and the hopes and aspirations that fueled
                abolition and emancipation can be found.</p>
                
            <p>To think Atlantically allows me to pose one regulative idea—that of the world as a
                centered experience that affirms the uniqueness of the white enfranchised self that
                is supported by peripheral others, in contrast to the disenfranchised (the world, in
                other words, of the colonial economic system)—against another regulative idea of the
                Atlantic as a fluid world of multiple and mobile players. It allows me to keep my
                students focused on the dynamic, fluid relation between center and periphery, larger
                and local contexts, and what is counted (money, bodies, trade items) and what does
                not count (lives). These are also the problems of sovereignty, and what in years
                past Romantic studies mainly focused on; they have only been transformed, but not
                displaced, in the slave trade economy and are the problems that Equiano marshals so
                well for his tale of self-recovery, innovation, and reinvention.</p>
                
            <p>The triangulation of texts, contextualized through websites on the histories of
                abolition and the slave trade, as well as a web-video of life on a virtual slave
                ship, a reconstruction of <hi rend="italic">L’Aurore</hi> (see also Rediker), allows
                students to connect to the voices that so clearly and emphatically tell their story
                or the stories of others. Most recently, the three chosen texts were those of
                Prince, Equiano, and James, which when triangulated situate the African, West
                Indian, and St. Domingue experience in a deeply involved perspective that includes
                the newly independent United States.<note place="foot"
                            > I find that research on slave testimonials
                            further helps students metabolize the truly painful passages of these
                            texts: both Thomas’s <hi rend="italic">Romanticism and Slave
                                Narratives</hi> and Aljoe’s <hi rend="italic">Creole
                                Testimonies</hi> have proved invaluable here.</note> Thus
                Equiano’s, Prince’s, and Toussaint’s achievements (self-improvement,
                self-liberation, and the liberation of a people) participate in the very conditions
                that fueled the French Revolution, financed by France’s slave-trade-enriched
                bourgeoisie, and the English abolition movement, which, as James argues, was
                encouraged by William Pitt as prime minister to deflect other political tensions
                (53–4). But triangulation requires positioning and revisiting: following Prince’s
                story with Equiano’s is achronological, but his rhetorically sophisticated style,
                because it distances and softens raw experience, allows for a more appreciative
                revisiting of Prince’s rhetorical moves. The clear parallels between Prince’s story
                of British colonial enslavement and Toussaint’s political speechmaking as he
                liberates both his fellow slaves and his island from colonial legal, economic, and
                political control enable students to bring together the three texts through both
                formal and experiential commonalities and differences.</p>
                
            <p>To balance the firsthand narrative unit on Prince, Equiano, and the Haitian
                Revolution, I designed a second unit focusing on women’s experience in fictional
                texts. Beginning with the anonymously authored <hi rend="italic">The Woman of
                    Colour, A Tale</hi> (1808), the students then read Jane Austen’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi> (1814), a novel that creates comparisons
                between women whose wealth makes them decadent and women who regard morality as more
                valuable. In each case the heroine’s transplantation into a different family depends
                on a reliance on the wealth generated by exploiting legal and capitalist networks
                that masked over the horrors of enslavement. Olivia Fairfield is the daughter of a
                Jamaican plantation owner and the majestic Marcia, a gifted but enslaved African
                woman. The conditions of Mr. Fairfield’s will are that Olivia is to be married into,
                or become the dependent of, her relations, the English Merton family. Fanny Price is
                adopted into her uncle Bertram’s family as a charity case, and in this sense Olivia
                and Fanny have opposed relations to plantation wealth but are in a chiasmic relation
                to each other that students can appreciate: the biracial heroine brings wealth with
                her, the white heroine brings only her poverty. Sir Thomas makes his wealth from his
                own Antiguan plantations though his family members, like Olivia’s relations in the
                Merton family, are residents in England. In both novels the women of these families
                display the decadent lifestyles and egocentrism created by West Indian caste
                divisions, and so stand in for what Olivia calls “the most die-away lady on the
                whole island of Jamaica” (73).<note place="foot" resp="author"> When applied to women, “die-away” signified
                            “languorous” and overly sentimental.</note> Both Olivia and
                Fanny take the role of outside observer, Olivia through her Jamaican birth and
                biracial identity and Fanny through her parents’ downward social mobility. Both are
                treated by their adoptive families as different in appearance (Olivia is beautiful
                and biracial, while Fanny is small and plain) and in kind (Olivia has a Black
                mother, and Fanny has a disreputable father). And both make observations that
                explicitly (Olivia) or implicitly (Fanny) compare the women of their adoptive
                families to the “decadent” behavior of West Indian women.</p>
                
            <p>However, in both novels the authorial insistence on a moral tale to be made of plot
                and characters enables the Caribbean plantation system itself to be glossed over. In
                    <hi rend="italic">The Woman of Colour</hi> this gloss is effected through
                Olivia’s fond remembrances of life on her father’s plantation, her frequent remarks
                concerning her firm connection to her enslaved brethren, and her affectionate
                descriptions of her maid Dido, whose race and pidgin English make clear her formerly
                enslaved status. In <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>, the masking is provided
                by Fanny’s translation of her uncle’s business concerns into a paternal treatment of
                his enslaved workers stemming from his moral rectitude. When these two novels are
                triangulated with Leonora Sansay’s short novel <hi rend="italic">Secret History; or,
                    The Horrors of St. Domingo</hi>, which like <hi rend="italic">The Woman of
                    Colour</hi> was also published in 1808, the plantation system’s inequities are
                unmasked. The white American narrator, Mary, visiting with her sister Clara in 1803,
                makes frequent criticisms of the behavior and regulation of different castes of
                women, from “coloured women” in general contrast to “white women,” to distinctions
                between “Mulatto” women (light-skinned biracial women), Creoles (white women born in
                St. Domingue, soon to be Haiti), French women (immigrants and visitors from France),
                and outsiders like Mary. Not only do sartorial distinctions demarcate castes among
                women in St. Domingue, but “here female virtue is blasted in the bud by the
                contagious influence of example” (96).</p>
                
            <p>As Sansay presents it, the very Caribbean air taints moral choice since sexual
                attraction alone determines women’s (limited) agency, so that “the mulatto women are
                the hated but successful rivals of the Creole ladies,” for they not only appear to
                be sexier but are also often wealthy: “before the revolution their splendor, their
                elegance, their influence over the men, and the fortunes lavished on them by their
                infatuated lovers, so powerfully excited the jealousy of the white ladies, that they
                complained to the council of the ruin their [“mulatto” women’s] extravagance
                occasioned to many [white] families, and a decree was issued imposing restrictions
                on their dress” (95).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Mary doesn’t seem to
                        know that “Mulatto” wealth more usually came from sons inheriting land and
                        money from their white fathers. She also doesn’t acknowledge “Noirs”
                        (persons of African birth, freed by Toussaint’s revolution) or most of the
                        other caste divisions that regulated life in St. Domingue.</note>
                Contrasted with the decadence of sexually explicit behavior is the novel’s real
                focus on political revolution; Toussaint’s post-revolutionary reign is looked
                forward to as utopian in comparison to the invading French forces there to support
                the white plantation owners. The armed forces’ destructive violence is mirrored in
                acts of male sexual aggression, exemplified in the rape of Mary’s sister Clara by
                her abusive husband, St. Louis. Sex and politics come together in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secret History</hi> in a manner that turns the lens on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Woman of Colour</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi>: suddenly
                students can realize how the sexual politics of those novels divide out into sexual
                aggression, the politics of race, and the loss of any moral compass when wealth
                depends on the unacknowledged suffering of enslaved laborers.</p>
                
            <p>To provide a component to this fictional unit that ties it back to the real-life
                narratives of Prince, Equiano, and Toussaint, I include here the first chapter of
                Sharpe’s <hi rend="italic">In the Wake</hi>. Sharpe’s meditations on, and
                theorization of, the historical effects of colonial schemes of skin color symbolism
                that Wynter analyzes yoke the development of colonial economies based on unpaid and
                enslaved labor. Sharpe’s reflections on her own and her family’s experience of the
                colonial symbolics of skin color (registered in Sansay’s delineation of the higher
                levels of St. Domingue’s caste system) illustrate so clearly how the colonial
                economy continues to mark the daily life of African Americans now. In the wake of
                the triangle slave trade, “the past that is not past reappears, always, to rupture
                the present” (9). Sharpe’s narrative, with its rhetorical insistence on the past’s
                ongoing harm, does more to make the connections between fiction and real-life
                narratives than news reports alone can do. As she notes, “Transatlantic slavery was
                and is the disaster” (5). Adding Sharpe’s critical reflections intermixed with
                personal narrative has the advantage of pulling the narrative and fictional units
                together because it enables further conversation about the economic and emotional
                risks of living in, and in the wake of, the triangle slave trade. This relates to
                Wynter’s analysis, which allows a conversation about colonial economies as a
                discourse concerning one’s relative worth.</p>
                
            <p>The question of personal versus fictionalized experience becomes a way to avoid
                simply comparing different encounters of slave and colonial life, racial prejudice,
                and degrees of gender violence. Instead, this comparison allows readers to
                triangulate and thus revisit/revise these three elements of the slave trade that the
                two units raise, allowing additional questions, such as one of inclusion/exclusion:
                Who is an insider, we could ask, and who is excluded in the system of colonial
                economy? Prince, Equiano, and Olivia present different kinds of outsider status, for
                instance. Moreover, female characters’ treatment at the hands of (usually white) men
                provides a quite different way to think about movement as well as about the stormy
                violence of the colonial economy and requires thinking harder about the movement
                through the color caste system in both British and French colonial and postcolonial
                life.</p>
                
            <p>Regardless of the texts selected to teach students how to see the experience of
                enslaved persons as belonging to lives that mattered, what has made the most
                difference in teaching this topic has been to find ways to make historical texts
                relevant. In order to move beyond that framework, I have begun working with current
                events and Afrofuturism. A useful supplemental text for exploring Afrofuturism is an
                essay by the award-winning novelist N. K. Jemisin, “How Long ’til Black Future
                Month?,” which provides a quick introduction to the main ideas of Afrofuturism.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This is also
                            the title of a collection of short stories by Jemisin, who is best known
                            for her <hi rend="italic">Broken Earth </hi>trilogy
                            (2015–2017), which won three Hugo awards. See also
                    O’Connell.</note> Writers like Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler made
                science fiction the most significant genre for Afrofuturist literature and film;
                these are texts that recast enslavers and colonists through the sci-fi tradition of
                encounter narratives.<note place="foot" resp="author"> H. G. Wells’s <hi rend="italic">The Time
                                Machine</hi> (1895), <hi rend="italic">The War of the Worlds</hi>
                            (1898), and <hi rend="italic">The First Men in the Moon</hi> (1901)
                            established the tradition. Andre Norton’s <hi rend="italic">Witch
                                World</hi> series (1963–1968) and Arthur C. Clarke’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Space Odyssey</hi> series (1968–1997) are well-known
                            first-encounter narratives.</note> An easily referenced text
                for teaching is the 2018 film <hi rend="italic">Black Panther</hi>, in which the
                imbrication of past, present, and future is clearly dramatized. In the film, the
                villain, Klaue, is depicted as an archetypal white adventurer despoiling African
                resources, but rather than being characterized as European he is clearly meant to
                suggest a heritage from the two Boer states of colonial Africa, with their brutal
                treatment of those inhabiting what is now South Africa. The Black Panther, T’Challa,
                defeats this despoiler and thus revises the historical first encounter with white
                enslavers; instead, we have a failed encounter that strengthens the progressive
                futurism of the Wakanda nation. This is not the best example, however, since Klaue
                should have been colonized by the Wakandan citizens, so asking students why Klaue’s
                death at the hands of T’Challa is a departure from Afrofuturism helps them see how
                easy it is to accept more pasteurized versions of Black narratives.</p>
                
            <p>“First encounter” narratives, made standard through works such as H. G. Wells’s <hi
                    rend="italic">The War of the Worlds</hi> (1898), merge with “second encounter”
                narratives so that the slave trade and colonial past is the pattern through which
                alien encounter is perceived, with the alien becoming the colonized victim of such
                thinking, and yet like the historical enslaved person, a victim who bears gifts. To
                historical enslaved people’s cultural and ideological gifts, these imagined aliens
                add technological and politically liberating gifts. Contrasting this model with the
                plot of <hi rend="italic">Black Panther</hi> allowed my students to view Equiano’s
                representation of slavery, kind masters, and British political elites as pasteurized
                rather than simply self-serving (as students often read his narrative). Most
                importantly, connecting the texts they are studying with the regulative idea of
                Afrofuturism—that sovereign nations need the induction of alien life in order to
                become even more democratic, free, and at peace—allows students to consider the
                problem of both individual sovereignty and national sovereignty as the product of
                fluidity and movement. It is not a given, it can be taken away, and it must always
                be put into conversation with the interrelatedness of ocean and land.</p>
                
            <p>When we revisited Equiano’s narrative after the <hi rend="italic">Black Panther</hi>
                exercise, I focused class discussion on the plan for a free Black state in Sierra
                Leone that Equiano participates in near the very end of his narrative; my students
                were able to rethink the potential of such an undertaking while also understanding
                it as a charity project rather than a utopian one (it is planned by “some
                philanthropic individuals” [242]). Pitting this scheme, devised by white
                politicians, against the utopian nation of Wakanda also helps us see why Equiano
                would have been so wary of the project: it lacks Wakanda’s self-determination
                arising from individual participation <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the necessary
                funding and resources (individual sovereignty <hi rend="italic">and</hi> national
                sovereignty). Through the contextualizing lens of Afrofuturism, my students came to
                the recognition that any settlement, however utopian, displaces those who already
                inhabit the land, disturbing the eco-balance of lives lived for both the established
                inhabitants and for the newcomers. In other words, the past can’t be undone by
                charity and welfare schemes; the hard work has to be done here in this place, as
                both the abolitionist materials and the lesson of Wakanda’s self-determination make
                clear. A useful discussion point is already provided here in thinking about our own
                future regarding territorialization practices versus Atlantic fluidity, the
                circulation and triangulations of persons and things versus the requirement for
                self-determination and lives well lived.</p>
                
            <p>Just as the trade in enslaved persons fueled white liberationist politics in both Britain’s
                American colonies and revolutionary France, so too has it grounded and set the stage
                for the more expansive empire through an increasingly laissez-faire liberally
                sanctioned world economy. Students begin to see the relation between things as they
                are and the horrifying, daily violence of the exchange in enslaved persons as
                mercantile objects. The necessity of teaching about the slave trade and the
                experience of enslavement alongside the heroized narratives of abolitionist
                political labor can be empowering in that it allows for the possibility of thinking
                about the future otherwise than in a traumatic and posthuman way. Certainly we must
                ask: What will prevail in the Atlantic world when environmental damage takes too
                great a toll on human habitations of the Caribbean? Or when the coastal cities and
                other human developments in the circum-Atlantic are submerged or simply destroyed?
                But a sense of play through more fluid boundaries allows space for students to
                imagine a different world-making from the one we have known and that currently goes
                on without our much noticing. It allows for thinking about different kinds of
                heroism, different ways of achieving self-determination against the apparently
                unstoppable weight of globalism. It allows for considering the ship in a stormy sea:
                fluidity and flexibility are the necessary survival skills, but they must be
                combined with a persistence to endure, a Mary-Prince-like self-heroism and a
                Toussaint-like vision. It seems to me that Atlanticism is poised to locate such
                an imagination if we allow its triangulatory effects room to do this kind of
                work.</p>

                    <p>This essay introduces strategies for reading and writing about Romantic-era antislavery literature in efforts to animate colonial textuality with Afro-Caribbean creative expressions. In this process, I am guided by the Jamaican concept of tunyuhan (“turn your hand”), or the practice of using available resources or materials to fashion something new and sustainable. My fieldwork in Jamaica and my collaboration with the Charles Town Maroons have informed my research methods, and I bring these inventive, dynamic practices into the classroom. Interweaving Romantic-period writing with contemporary, nonliterary, and occasionally disturbing texts, we consider ways that in reframing the past and interrogating its brutal aftermaths, we might imagine a better future. </p>

            <p>Reading literature about slavery gives students a glimpse into Black lives in the
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but that’s not enough. Romantic-era accounts of
                slavery can whitewash the harrowing realities of plantation life, and even some
                authors of these texts acknowledge the ways their work has endured the interventions
                of their editors or imagined audiences. Whether excerpted, edited and “mard” (John
                Gabriel Stedman), transcribed or “pruned” (Mary Prince), “styled” (Olaudah Equiano),
                or “soiled” (William Earle), these texts bear the marks of the literary and social
                institutions and cultures that produced them. My pedagogical approach relies on
                introducing students to other kinds of texts beyond Romantic-era narratives to
                animate colonial textuality with the creative expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture,
                which, in revising the past, imagines and nourishes future worlds. Inspired by
                Afro-Jamaican “tun yuh han mek fashion” techniques of improvisation and
                sustainability, I work with these materials, often contemporary and nonliterary, to
                refashion studies in Romanticism.</p>
                
            <p>Gaama Gloria Simms (she goes by the honorific “MaMa G”), a Trelawny Maroon and
                Rastafarian, taught me about <hi rend="italic">tunyuhan</hi>. The term refers to the
                Jamaican proverb “tun yuh han (turn your hand) [and] mek (make) fashion,” or to make
                the best use of available resources to create something new and sustainable.
                Afrocentric and inherently revolutionary, tunyuhan, as Kaiton Williams argues, “is
                tied up with the multiple and evolving sources of income and pastimes from which we
                source our identity” (par. 5).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Williams associates tunyuhan with the “DIY
                            mentality” that defines the Jamaican response to “material absence” and
                            also sees it as “a way to repair a break in the continuity of people and
                            culture sustained in the creation of our New World” (par. 8). She
                            writes, “All those revolutions, rebellions and projects of independence
                            continue to be as much about making our world as about remaking our
                            relation to it,” proposing also that Jamaican multiplicity “is central
                            to our curious embrace of freedom: our expression of our soul and its
                            determination” (par. 3).</note> MaMa G, for example, plans to
                create and market a line of clothing and accessories made from repurposed materials
                as part of a therapy program for abused or vulnerable women to give them emotional
                and economic support. She aims also to establish small farms for self-subsistence,
                thus empowering Jamaican women and their communities. Taking her social and
                intellectual work abroad through invited lectures and workshops, MaMa G envisions
                opening a “borderless university,” located in Jamaica but developed online, to unite
                local and global communities in the project of disseminating indigenous knowledge.
                MaMa G’s financial circumstances—in part a rejection of modern capitalism—have
                inspired her to create alternative modes of survival that rely on resourcefulness,
                improvisation, and adaptability. Inspired by MaMa G and intrigued by the concept of
                tunyuhan, I try to apply its inventive, collaborative practices to my teaching and
                research.</p>

            <p>I first met MaMa G through my research on the notorious Jamaican fugitive
                Three-Fingered Jack (Jack Mansong), as I tracked stories about the Maroons who
                killed him. Looking back, I realize that our first meeting taught me to (try to)
                relax into a kind of nonteleological, suspended (sometimes surreal) state, very
                different from the structure and solipsism of archival pursuits. “Everyday life is
                our classroom,” MaMa G has explained to me, and “if you are not living it, you are
                so far from it [knowledge].” Fieldwork in Jamaica has taught me to find knowledge
                everywhere, reveling in what Paul Youngquist calls “ambient knowledge” (218).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Shalani Puri
                            has proposed that we consider what she calls “fieldwork in the
                            Humanities” for access “to knowledge and expression unavailable in
                            print; to disallowed or delegitimized knowledges; to localized or
                            vernacular rather than globalized knowledge and memory”
                    (59).</note> I have found it in the “yards” (homes) of contemporary
                Maroons, in conversations with taxi drivers, with fellow passengers on buses, in rum
                shops, at music events, on road trips, and etched in the landscape of the island;
                I’ve had conversations about Three-Fingered Jack in kitchens, in farmyards, on
                hiking trails, in rivers, on mountains, and in bat-filled caves. Cooperative,
                networked, improvisational, and dynamic, these perspectives have helped me to, as
                Bob Marley would put it, “lively up” my research.</p>
                    
            <p>The connections I’ve made in Jamaica took time and tunyuhan to evolve into
                collaboration. My fieldwork began with the Maroons of Charles Town, when their
                remarkable colonel, the late Frank Lumsden, introduced me to his community and,
                indirectly, to MaMa G.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Colonel
                            Lumsden was elected in 2004, remaining in office until his death.
                            Jamaica has four, arguably five, existing Maroon villages: Charles Town,
                            Moore Town, Scots Hall, Accompong, and, controversially,
                            Trelawny/Flagstaff. Maroon communities are self-governing, and in each
                            of the Jamaican Maroon towns, the community elects or installs a colonel or chief,
                            who governs with the assistance of a council. However, the Jamaican
                            government periodically challenges the economic, social, and political
                            autonomy of the Maroons (Bilby, “Maroon Autonomy”).</note> I
                first met Colonel Lumsden at Kingston’s Red Bones Blues Café in 2008, upon his
                delivery of one of his paintings to its proprietor and our mutual friend, Evan
                Williams. We had been hearing about each other for months. Over cold Red Stripe
                beers, I asked Colonel Lumsden if I might visit Charles Town to interview him and
                others about Three-Fingered Jack. As it happened, Colonel Lumsden had been looking
                for an academic to organize an international conference in Charles Town to fulfill
                his vision of a global indigenous community. We struck a deal, and this relationship
                continues to enrich and beautifully complicate my life, even after his death in
                2015. I traveled to Portland, Jamaica, in June 2009 to help establish the first
                International Charles Town Maroon Conference, and in those summer months I spent
                time with Colonel Sterling of Moore Town, Colonel Marcia “Kim” Douglas of Charles Town (deceased 2024), Lynette Wilkes, Worries McCurbin, Brother Isaac Bernard, Keith
                Lumsden, and other Windward Maroons, building relationships that have grown
                    since.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The
                            Maroon villages are traditionally divided into Windward (on the east
                            side of the island) and Leeward (on the west side). Windward Maroon
                            villages include Charles Town, Moore Town, and Scots Hall; those in the
                            Leeward group are Accompong and Trelawny.</note> It took
                another two years for me to meet MaMa G, entirely by chance, through Colonel Prehay
                of the Scots Hall Maroons.</p>
                    
            <p>I met with Colonel Prehay in the temporary office of a visiting Maroon official in
                uptown Kingston. I found the space (with some effort) in a residential building
                adjacent to the wedding-cake-shaped Devon House, an estate built in 1881 by
                Jamaica’s first Black millionaire. In their distinctive hand-crafted coconut hats,
                Col. Prehay and MaMa G sat patiently in the waiting area amidst the pastel décor of
                the mysterious office, and I awkwardly asked questions about Three-Fingered Jack.
                Neither had much to say about him. But MaMa G did have quite a bit to say about
                Indigenous women, the Trelawny Maroons, and the power of improvisation for
                sustainability. I didn’t get information for my book that day, but I decided to
                follow my instincts, realizing when she invited me to her home that I had an
                opportunity to learn from this wise woman.</p>
                    
            <p>A few days later and after some logistical mishaps, I arrived at MaMa G’s East
                Kingston home with what would become my customary offering: a pineapple, four Red
                Stripes, and an orange juice for her granddaughter, Cookie. MaMa G’s East Kingston
                “yard” provided a shady, breezy haven, with multiple signs of her community
                involvement in evidence. I wasn’t sure exactly what I was doing there because MaMa G
                had expressed a marked lack of interest in Three-Fingered Jack. But I felt drawn to
                her energy, and our initial conversations focused on her frustrated departure from
                the social-work program at the University of the West Indies and her subsequent
                commitment to grassroots community organizing. That afternoon, MaMa G introduced me
                to the concept of tunyuhan as she carefully stitched an elaborate hat wrought with
                coconut husk and recycled thread, a creation she would proudly wear as she delivered
                a talk to the United Nations several years later. Instead of extricating facts about
                Three-Fingered Jack, I developed strategies for acquiring knowledge beyond the
                archive. I learned to slow down, listen, wait, and even let go of (or at least
                defer) my intended goals. I found that knowledge should be about exchange rather
                than extraction and that it requires openness, creativity, and improvisation. These
                skills help in the classroom, too.</p>

            <head>Tunyuhan in the Classroom</head>
                    
            <p>I teach at a large public university, and most English professors have limited
                opportunities to teach classes in their areas of specialization because the number
                of majors has been declining, as part of a national trend. When we offer Romanticism
                or the long eighteenth century, we face extra pressure from students to keep it
                fresh and relevant to our increasingly diverse student population. I use tunyuhan to
                make available a more textured and topical understanding of Romantic antislavery
                texts. Motivated by my Jamaican research and the interdisciplinarity of the Maroon
                conference, I use the resources available to me, borrowing from other fields,
                experimenting with different genres, and branching into other centuries. I used this
                approach in an upper-level seminar for English majors that focused on eighteenth-
                and nineteenth-century representations of slavery.</p>
                    
            <p>I designed the course to interweave colonial and postcolonial literary and
                nonliterary texts. With tunyuhan’s multiplicity in mind, I incorporated interviews,
                images, and films to complement and challenge the conventions of literary
                historiography. Organized chronologically, the class began with travel writing
                (Lydia Maria Child’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of
                    Surinam</hi> [1838], extracted from John Gabriel Stedman’s narrative of his
                military expedition to Surinam) and transitioned to Eurocentric fiction (John
                Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</hi>
                and Victor Hugo’s <hi rend="italic">Bug-Jargal</hi>). We followed fiction
                with the voices of formerly enslaved people (Mary Prince’s
                <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave </hi>[1831]
                and Olaudah Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of
                    Olaudah Equiano</hi> [1789]). And we finished with contemporary Jamaican fiction
                (Marlon James’s <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> [2009]). For the
                purposes of this essay, I will discuss only my classroom use of Child, Earle,
                Prince, and James, situating these texts within larger cultural and creative
                contexts. The Maroons played a significant role in my course partly because they are
                so often neglected, but also because their cultural and spiritual practices
                emphasize the connections I want to make between past, present, and future. Each
                unit also included the creative expressions of contemporary Afro-Jamaicans,
                disrupting the linearity of the syllabus to suggest the ways that the past leaves
                its mark on the present, as well as the ways that reimagining the past can inspire
                future generations.</p>
                    
            <p>Tunyuhan practices will vary in the hands of different teachers and scholars because
                the method involves the creative pursuit of individual interests and inspirations.
                One makes the best use of the available resources, whatever they may be for that
                person. Rather than following a list of suggested texts, videos, or websites, the
                teacher/scholar will experiment with unique combinations of texts or ideas. Dynamic
                and inventive, tunyuhan opens up possibilities and connections.<note place="foot" resp="author"> A reviewer of
                            this essay thoughtfully asked me what the tunyuhan approach would look
                            like in different hands than mine, wondering, too, how or where to meet
                            people like MaMa G. In short, every person will have a different
                            approach based on their interests and resources. My collaboration with
                            the Maroons and MaMa G grew from my interest in their history in
                            relationship to my project on Three-Fingered Jack. It took years to
                            cultivate these relationships, but the honor of their acquaintance led
                            me to other opportunities too. The International Charles Town Maroon
                            Conference and Festival, for example, continues to offer opportunities
                            for professors and graduate students to engage with and learn about
                            Maroon culture from contemporary Maroons and Indigenous peoples and
                            scholars from around the world.</note></p>
                    
            <p>My work with the annual International Charles Town Maroon Conference and Festival has
                increasingly informed my teaching as well as my research. Set in the Asafu Yard—once
                a communal space to prepare for battle—it combines academic panels with drumming,
                dancing, wellness workshops, and sacred ritual. Interdisciplinary,
                intergenerational, and collaborative, this event takes academics out of their
                comfort zone and creates connections with contemporary Maroons, local Jamaicans, and
                other international scholars. Researchers meet the descendants of the people they
                study and teach; they hear their voices, listen to their stories, and dance to their
                music. Literary scholars mingle with geographers, geneticists with poets, and
                Maroons with ethnomusicologists.</p>
                    
            <p>Many of the visiting scholars fold archival time into this trip, and their research
                shifts as they move through experiences with people that, unlike archival records,
                speak to and with them. Experiencing alternative models for the production of
                knowledge, participants return to their campuses with more than the photocopies and
                facts that serve the archival imperative and its hierarchies. I’ve worked to bring
                this kind of knowledge into my classroom by using (filmed, digitized, or recorded)
                Maroon stories, songs, rituals, and artwork, for example, to enliven the print
                texts. This “undisciplined” mode of assembly responds to the call for what Christina
                Sharpe terms “wake work” and attends to “the largeness that is Black Life, Black
                life insisted from death” (17). These materials can also show the limitations,
                porousness, and vulnerabilities of logocentric knowledge.</p>
                    
            <p>Stedman, author of <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the
                    Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi> (1796), bemoaned the editorial intrusions that
                “mard” his narrative (as cited by Stedman, xlix). An officer in the Dutch army
                deployed to the colony of Surinam to quell the revolt of the Maroons in 1772,
                Stedman submitted his narrative to a London publisher and bookseller, Joseph
                Johnson. The 1796 published version, much to Stedman’s irritation, differed
                significantly from his original account, particularly in its representation of
                Joanna (documented in Richard and Sally Price’s 1998 transcription of his 1790
                manuscript). I won’t rehearse here the fascinating intricacies of what Dustin
                Kennedy has termed the “Stedman Archive,” though I did begin there with my
                    students.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            In addition to Kennedy, see also Jenny Sharpe (2002) and
                        Gwilliam.</note> I chose for my course text, however, not Stedman’s
                narrative but Child’s extraction of it, <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Joanna; An
                    Emancipated Slave, of Surinam,</hi> first published in an 1834 gift book, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Oasis.</hi><note place="foot" resp="author"> This first version was titled <hi rend="italic"
                                >Joanna, or the Female Slave: A West Indian Tale</hi>
                            (1834). In the second
                            version (1838), Child replaced “female slave” with “emancipated slave,”
                            though Joanna remained enslaved until her death.</note> I
                wanted to track different kinds of mediations that feature in writings about
                slavery, even when produced by white men with relative power.</p>
                    
            <p>Child appropriated Stedman’s narrative for her own abolitionist purposes, but not
                without ideological contradictions. For example, she admires the domestic affections
                of Stedman and Joanna, yet she insists that abolitionists do not “induce anyone to
                marry a mulatto, even should their lives be saved by such an one” (3). Her concerns
                with propriety and miscegenation extend to her visual choices. Johnson’s edition
                includes illustrations by the British engraver and portraitist Thomas Holloway.
                Among them is an image of a bare-breasted Joanna; Child replaced this image with a
                more modest one by a Boston engraver, George Girdler Smith. We studied both, which
                prompted one irritated but engaged student to ask, “What’s up with her boobie?” A
                good question. It’s a cover-up. Jenny Sharpe has suggested that cloaking Joanna’s
                breasts desexualizes and yet emphasizes her role as wife and mother, registering the
                gender politics of women abolitionists like Child (85). My students and I agreed
                that it also covers up the violence visited upon enslaved women, whitewashing the
                realities of sexual exploitation in the colonies. In addition, Child almost entirely
                excludes the Maroons with whom Joanna had family connections and whose rebellions
                brought Stedman to Surinam in the first place. I had the students read a few
                Maroon-focused chapters from Stedman’s narrative with some Maroon historiography,
                which sparked their interest in the history of these self-emancipated Afro-Caribbean
                peoples.</p>
                    
            <p>Improvising, I introduced some additional background on the Maroons of Suriname and
                Jamaica and showed them a video of MaMa G’s enstoolment (installation) by the
                Okanisi Maroons as the first woman Gaama, the highest political position among the
                Maroons of Suriname (“Installation”).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Also spelled Ga’aama, Gaa’man, and
                            Gaa’mang.</note> A historic ceremony performed in Charles Town
                by spiritual leaders of the Surinamese and Jamaican Maroons, it showed how
                Afrocentric rituals are preserved, honored, and practiced in the Caribbean today.
                Because the ceremony took place at the Maroon conference, students witnessed the
                interactions between the local community and visiting scholars at this particularly
                moving event, showing them a different kind of scholarly method. (<ref target=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pXhVHCFELA">Youtube</ref>).</p>
                    
            <p>Next, the class viewed a short docudrama about Nanny of the Maroons,
                <hi rend="italic">Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess </hi>(2015),
                featuring MaMa G in a dramatization of the title character. Overtly addressing the
                dearth of archival material about Nanny (only four sources), Roy T. Anderson’s film
                features oral histories, music, and dance, and it includes interviews with Maroon
                leaders, Olympic athletes, politicians, and historians. My students especially liked
                the footage of a group of scholars and Maroons hiking to the remote former military
                stronghold of Nanny Town. As one student wrote in a response paper: “The expedition
                to Nanny Town up in the mountains shows that even now islanders still hold to these
                ancient places and honor the spirits of the past there. I was surprised to learn
                that many of the places in Jamaican folklore still exist such as Nanny Town to
                remember a leader who took down the British, a kick-butt woman who could catch
                bullets in her butt.”<note place="foot" resp="author">All student authors quoted have given permission
                            for their statements to be shared.</note></p>
                    
            <p>The students enjoyed the film, so I showed them additional video clips of
                contemporary Jamaican Maroons performing or explaining their lifeways (“Colonel
                Frank Lumsden,” “Charles Town Maroons,” and “Charles Town Drummers”). Another student
                wrote that “hearing from local Maroons such as Colonel Frank Lumsden and Delano
                Douglas gives the world a better idea of Maroons as lovers of nature and defenders
                of their cultural history in comparison with racist, colonialist generalizations
                that we read.” Other students agreed that the paratextual materials “made Maroon

            <p>Earle’s epistolary novel <hi rend="italic">Obi </hi>likewise
                elides the role of the Maroons in his account of the fugitive from slavery who was
                captured and killed by them in 1780. Earle’s novel falls short of its abolitionist
                reach, and though it misrepresents the free status of Maroons, it reveals the
                complex dynamics of a colonial state that pitted Afro-Jamaicans against one another.
                The weepy, unreliable narrator, however, inspires little confidence, especially in
                his repetition of the phrase “I am no author” (118). Famously overwrought and
                ideologically incoherent, Earle’s “sentimentalist abolitionism” (50), though
                brilliantly edited and annotated by Srinivas Aravamudan in the 2005 Broadview Press
                edition, has never been a crowd-pleaser for my students.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Aravamudan observes that Obi “is
                            written with a view to eliciting the feeling tear or the melancholic
                            sigh of the sentimentalist reader and the abolitionist activist”
                            (8).</note></p>
                    
            <p>I can’t blame the students for their frustration with Earle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Obi</hi>, against which we (much more to their interest) explored contemporary
                images of Jack and the Maroon who killed him. First, we studied the Jamaican artist
                Omari “Afrikan” Ra’s extraordinary painting of Three-Fingered Jack (n.d.), and the
                class listened to my recorded interview with the artist, who spoke of the influences
                of revolutionaries Makandal and Dutty Boukman. The students used Ra’s image to
                imagine a more nuanced picture of the infamous outlaw. They commented on his hard,
                intense stare and the words etched around his neck, perhaps suggesting the ways he’s
                been imprisoned by print. The students also found it interesting to think about
                Jack’s relationship to Quashie (also called “John Reeder”), the Maroon who took off
                Jack’s fingers and later killed him. Colonel Lumsden’s stunning painting of Quashie,
                in white face paint and rendered in “ambush,” depicts the complexity of this
                underrepresented figure in Jack’s story.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> “Ambush” refers to the Maroon tactic of
                            camouflage for the purposes of surprise attack.</note> One
                student commented, “The depth and intricacy of Quashie’s eyes and the surrounding
                patterns of greenery remind us that, in the end, Quashie is still a Maroon and that
                he would make his own ruthless decisions” (Fig. 2). These Afrocentric images of Jack
                and his killer usefully trouble Eurocentric textual accounts of colonial Jamaica
                with their depictions of proud Black warriors forced into opposition with one
                another by a brutal system.</p>

            <p>To conclude the Three-Fingered Jack unit, we watched clips of dancehall/reggae artist
                Buju Banton’s “Long Walk to Freedom” tour. This self-identified Maroon was released
                from a U.S. prison in December 2018, reminding my students that the
                prison-industrial complex functions as an extension of plantation slavery (Kreps).
                Buju Banton represents a potent expression of Black agency, harnessing the legacy of
                the island’s first freedom fighters. Putting Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi</hi> in
                conversation with contemporary Jamaican art and music amplifies Jack’s militant
                legacy of uncompromising resistance.</p>

                published <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women,</hi> a

                Black agency in a system that rewards accommodation. James’s novel links
                thematically and geographically to Earle’s <hi rend="italic">Obi</hi> (and to Buju

            <p>Much like Child’s <hi rend="italic">Joanna</hi>, Prince’s antislavery narrative
                underwent a complex editorial process, one that continues into the twenty-first
                century (Sinanan). Prince’s sponsor, Thomas Pringle (secretary of the Anti-Slavery
                Society), claimed that the illiterate Prince herself suggested to him the “idea of
                writing [her] history” so that “the good people in England might hear from a slave
                what a slave had felt and suffered” (3). Though Pringle claimed in his preface to
                Prince’s account that “no fact of importance” had been omitted or “a single
                circumstance or sentiment” added, his significant supplement offers materials that
                at once substantiate and contradict his defense of her character and the validity of
                her antislavery narrative.<note place="foot" resp="author"> When her enslaver, John Wood, refused to sell
                            Prince her manumission, the Anti-Slavery Society petitioned Parliament
                            (without success). The publication of her account prompted two
                            pro-slavery attacks and a subsequent series of civil suits. See Jenny
                            Sharpe (2002), Ferguson, and Todorova for discussions of the Prince
                            archive.</note> Subject to the Anti-Slavery Society’s notions
                of decency, Prince’s account itself (like Child’s <hi rend="italic">Joanna</hi>)
                reveals only insinuations of her sexual encounters, solicited and not, after it was
                transcribed and bowdlerized by the Methodist abolitionist Susanna Moodie and
                “pruned” (3) by Pringle.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Only in her later testimony in the court case that
                            her former owner, Wood, brought against Pringle (and won) did Prince
                            speak of her sexual relationships with the free Black man Oyskman and
                            the white Captain Abbot.</note></p>
                    
            <p>Prince’s narrative alludes to sexual assault by her “indecent” enslaver but goes no
                further than describing his “ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked” and
                ordering her “to wash him in a tub of water” (24). When she resisted, he would beat
                her severely, once prompting her to run away until the next morning. Prince’s
                account interweaves silences about rape with acts of resistance. Yet even as Prince
                censors her narrative to protect herself from allegations of promiscuity, Pringle
                included in his supplement a letter that mentions Prince’s sexual relationship with
                an unnamed “Capt.” and noted that “such connexions are so common” as to be almost
                universal (51). Pringle’s ambiguating supplemental materials gave my students the
                tools to piece together a version of her experience that reveals Black agency and
                exposes some of the truths (the “common connexions”) concealed by a white literary
                culture. But it was James’s deployment of Prince’s narrative in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Book of Night Women</hi> that students most fully engaged with. In his
                riveting novel, James adapts Prince’s bathtub incident to foreground rather than
                silence the violence of rape on the plantation, imagining, too, how revenge might
                look.</p>
                    
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women, </hi>the
                mixed-race protagonist, Lilith, spills hot soup on a visitor while serving dinner
                and endures daily lashings and a gang rape as punishment until her enslaver sends
                her to be seasoned by his future parents-in-law. At her new post, Lilith’s rage
                boils over, and when Massa Roget demands his bath-time sexual servicing (clearly
                evoking Prince), Lilith drowns him and sets fire to the house to hide the evidence,
                killing all its inhabitants, adults and children, enslaved and
                free. Despite this act,
                Lilith resists joining plans for a multi-plantation rebellion engineered by the
                enslaved head domestic, Homer, and Lilith’s half-sisters, the titular “Night Women.”
                Instead, Lilith becomes mistress to the new overseer, Robert Quinn, because she
                needs his protection from her previous tormentors. Already scarred with a “quilt” on
                her back, Lilith fears the fate of Homer, who once ran away, and when caught by
                Maroons, underwent a public flogging: “She cover up in scar big like animal stripe,
                her titties chop up and scar up so that is only nipple left to tell you that she
                born to suckle” (382). Under Quinn’s protection, Lilith suspects she can keep her
                own breasts intact and (like Joanna) covered. Ambivalent and with divided loyalties,
                Lilith at once accommodates and undermines the plantation system, oblivious to the
                contradictions that link her to the Maroons, whom the novel frequently criticizes
                for their collaboration with the British.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> In a process that involved written
                            documents and the ritual oath of drinking blood mixed with rum, the
                            British negotiated a treaty with the Maroons in 1739. The British and
                            Maroons held completely different notions about the treaty. The British
                            viewed it as the means to control the Maroons, and the infamous ninth
                            clause commits the Maroons to returning fugitives and putting down
                            island rebellions. For Maroons, the treaty celebrated their victory over
                            the English after eighty years of war. Many non-Maroon Jamaicans view
                            the Maroons as traitors because of the treaty, not unreasonably, driving
                            anti-Maroon sentiment in Jamaica today. MaMa G views the treaty as a
                            “trick,” informing my view of it as yet another example of English
                            methods of divide and conquer, pitting Afro-Jamaicans against one
                            another. For accounts of Maroon history, see Bilby, Campbell (1988),

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> reveals the brutalities as well as the
                contradictions of plantation slavery, a system that rewards accommodation. Even the
                rebellious Homer wrangles considerable power as head domestic, a position from which
                she gained access to literacy. When she teaches young Lilith to read, she explains,
                “Every time you open this [a book] you free” (57). Skilled in the spiritual as well
                as the literary arts, Homer practices obeah and myal, and she guides the Night Women
                in African-descended rituals that challenge European systems of power and knowledge.
                Homer works the system, using all tools available, and she, like Lilith, has thus
                become entangled with the power structure they resist.<note place="foot" resp="author"> New research on Ajami script

                            that Homer is reclaiming the written word from an African tradition and
                            not a Western one, complicating the binary between orality and literacy

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women </hi>performs the
                tensions between literary and vernacular culture, invoking the dual relationship
                that Sylvia Wynter identifies between the “plantation” (the educated artist) and the
                “plot” (folk), particularly in its revelation of Lovey Quinn, Lilith’s daughter, in
                the final pages.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In “Novel and History, Plot and Plantation,” Wynter
                            argues that the history of Caribbean society “is that of a dual relation
                            between plantation [the elite] and plot [the folk], the two poles which
                            originate in a single historical process” (99). In doing so they created
                            a folk culture that persists in resistant “secretive” histories,
                            expressed, for example, in folk songs, kumina practices, or myal rituals
                            (101). Wynter maintains that Caribbean literature registers the
                            ambivalence between the plot and the plantation but sees the ambivalence
                            as at once “the root cause of our alienation” as well as its “salvation”
                            (99).</note> Lilith schooled Lovey with a reading list that
                includes Jane Austen’s <hi rend="italic">Sense and Sensibility</hi> (1811), Henry

                    rend="italic">The History of Jamaica</hi> (1774). Lovey remarks that Lilith
                taught her to write—“the most forbidden of thing”—so that “when the time come to
                write her song she have somebody true to be her witness” (426–7). Lovey uses her
                literacy to document the Night Women’s brave battles and violent deaths, learned
                through Homer and Lilith from songs devised and disseminated by Lilith’s
                half-sister, Gorgon; these songs celebrated the Night Women and scorned the white
                creoles, who tried but failed to contain their circulation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lilith and

                            in the destruction of the plantation, and afterward she remains in the
                            house and “live[s] like a free negro” though she is not free (422).
                            Injured almost to the point of death, Homer survives to live in the

            <p>The inclusion of
                <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women </hi>on my syllabus
                raised some eyebrows. Indeed, contemporary debates about content warnings in the
                classroom have in some cases prompted institutional resistance to exposing the
                gruesome details and residues of the Atlantic slave trade. Yet the study of texts
                about slavery should, with all due respect and sensitivity toward the experiences or
                traumas of students, confront and illuminate the historical realities that have
                shaped the anti-Blackness and structural racism of current cultures. My “note on
                content” in my syllabus acknowledges that these texts touch on the lived experiences
                of some students more than others, demanding respect and tolerance as we move
                through difficult material. James’s unapologetically graphic language and violent
                imagery understandably disturbed the students, but it also extended and enriched our
                ongoing conversation about the sanitization of representations of slavery.</p>
                    
            <p>Many of the students wrote their seminar papers about <hi rend="italic">The Book of

                and unlike anything they had ever read. Almost every page reveals some devastating
                detail of slavery as James harrowingly pursues the elisions and ambivalences
                sometimes found even in overtly antislavery texts. James has been dubbed the
                “literary Tarantino” (the class also watched Quentin Tarantino’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Django Unchained</hi> [2012]), and as a gay Black Jamaican, James explains that
                he tries to complicate rather than ignore the island’s past and present violence,
                writing instead about “a Jamaica that never gets written” (as cited by Cain, n.
                pag.; see also Akbar). As an academic (a professor at Macalester College) and a
                Booker Prize–winning author, James occupies the space of the archive, but he uses
                that access to disrupt it, fully and critically aware of the contradictions
                    therein.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            James has blamed rejections of his work on the popularity of “cultural
                            ventriloquism” in fiction, where white authors write “in a ‘palatable’
                            way about countries and cultures of which they have no experience” (as
                            cited by Cain, n. pag.).</note></p>
                    
            <p>Critics have convincingly written about the “Power of the Neo-Slave Narrative Genre”
                and its ability to simultaneously attend to the past and future (Anim-Addo and Lima
                    6).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                            Anim-Adda and Lima’s special issue of <hi rend="italic">Callaloo</hi>
                            for a fantastic conversation about the genre. Invoking Stuart Hall, they
                            urge us to consider identity as a dynamic, always-constitutive
                            “production” (6). Their introduction (and the issue itself) nicely
                            theorizes and performs the power of the neo-slavery genre, calling
                            attention to its particular relevance to Black British writing as it
                            revises “the way in which British history is understood and remembered .
                            . . [by exploring] the continuing legacies of slavery into
                            twenty-first-century realities—economic and social inequity, racism, and
                            the impossibility of fully belonging—which suggests that it is only by
                            the full avowal of the past of slavery that the present might be
                            understood and the future imagined” (2).</note> I find James’s
                novel an especially useful though unsettling way to reconsider the history of
                slavery and its Romantic-period representations. Even arguably antislavery texts and
                politically aware interpretations of them reflect the structural racism of the
                institutions (nineteenth-century British plantation and/or literary culture and
                twenty-first-century academia, for example) that participate in the cultural
                production of race. In putting the creative expressions of contemporary Black
                culture in conversation with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary texts, I
                hope to move beyond glimpses of Black lives under slavery into broader landscapes
                that privilege Black agency, resistance, and life.</p>
                    
            <p>Interweaving different kinds of texts in new combinations, I conjure the spirit of
                tunyuhan and its commitment to creating new things from old materials. This idea is
                not new to Romanticism. Mary Shelley, for example, writes in her introduction to <hi
                    rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> (1831) that invention is borne out of chaos and
                “consists in . . . the power of moulding and <hi rend="italic">fashioning</hi> ideas
                suggested to it” (viii, emphasis added). As her novel shows, people tend to fear
                what they view to be “dark” or “shapeless,” but the modern academy generally, and
                the field of Romanticism particularly, could benefit from some creative if
                uncomfortable admixture to animate existing materials. Bakary Diaby has asked
                Romanticists to “do the work” to change the way we study Blackness in Romanticism
                (249). Until we have a new system (and I’m not holding my breath), we can experiment
                with and refashion the one we have.</p>

            <p>In the spring of 2020, I was going to take a group of students on a study abroad
                program to Jamaica, bringing my classroom into the field. Like most research and all
                conference travel that year, “Histories of Resistance in Jamaica” was cancelled by
                Covid-19. Instead, my institution asked me to develop a four-week online course that
                would give my students the Jamaica experience (!). Improvising with the medley of
                materials available to me (some from the class I just described), I created the
                course, including a public event using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra that featured
                MaMa G. Instead of the activities she and I had planned for my fifteen Jamaica-bound
                students, she gave an interactive workshop for forty students and faculty titled
                “Re-awakening the Knowledge and Wisdoms of Indigenous Women in Times of Covid-19.”
                With the (occasionally blurry) Ultra phone app and the Blue Mountains misting over
                the Asafu Yard, MaMa G created a unique virtual space for student engagement.</p>
                    
            <p>In a conversation that invoked the creative invention and adaptability of tunyuhan,
                MaMa G emphasized “Maroon principles of survival,” grafted from “knowledge [we]
                brought from Africa, learned from the [indigenous] Taino, and even now it continues”
                    (Simms).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            To protect students’ privacy the video capture of the Blackboard
                            Collaborate workshop is not publicly available; quotations in the text
                            were transcribed by the author.</note> Calling for a “shift in
                consciousness,” a “reawakening,” she urges a return to indigenous knowledge that
                values other cultures and respects the natural environment from which “we can always
                find a solution.” Wellness, she concluded, “comes from communication between body,
                earth, mind, spirit, and land—it’s all part of our healing.”</p>
                    
            <p>As teachers of texts about slavery, we can show students that its aftermaths are
                ongoing and interrelated, as demonstrated in part by the racism, police brutality,
                and unrest during the 2020 Covid-19 crisis, a public health catastrophe particularly
                critical for underserved Black communities. The creative and exciting global
                responses to these events signaled, as MaMa G suggests, an outcry and an opportunity
                for change. We can remake Romanticism, changing our approach to texts about slavery
                not only to confront and illuminate their violence and amnesia but also to
                incorporate and celebrate the “largeness that is Black life” (Christina Sharpe 17).
                If we want our institutions and disciplines to survive, we need to work with the
                materials we have to create something new and sustainable. Tun yuh han mek

                <p>This essay analyzes the powerful nexus between antislavery pedagogy, recognizing
                one’s own historical agency, and engaging in civic action in the context of the
                Black Lives Matter movement. I explore my own role as a pre-service teacher, social
                justice activist, and emerging scholar in the field of education in the context of
                the antislavery archive that shaped my undergraduate research and study. I place the
                work of Ottobah Cugoano and other Romantic-era and long-nineteenth-century authors
                in dialogue with Marxist theory, as well as with the work of Paulo Freire, to
                explore how unexpected interconnections between these texts emerge in the contexts
                of teaching, scholarship, and activism.</p>

                <div type="section">
            <p>When my fellow Black Lives Matter activists and I arrived at the corner of Lowell
                Street and Russell Street in West Peabody, Massachusetts in order to stage a
                counterprotest in July 2020, we were immediately approached by members of the town’s
                police department and told that we had to relocate down the street to a marked-off
                location. Allegedly, the corner of the public sidewalk where we intended to rally
                had been reserved by a group under the organization of Dianna Ploss, a former radio
                host who had lost her job at a New Hampshire station after filming herself
                “berat[ing] landscape workers for speaking Spanish” (Taylor and Waller). When we
                informed one of the police officers that we were not moving to the designated zone
                down the street and that our counterprotest would continue as planned, the situation
                intensified. Our small group was quickly surrounded by seven officers, and after a
                conversation about our right to occupy this public space, we were told, “The
                debate’s over.” Yet the end of the debate about which space we should occupy would
                also have meant an end to the counterprotest itself, since that too was a form of
                debate.</p>
                    
            <p>Fortunately, I know that a permit is not needed to protest in the city of Peabody,
                and that public sidewalks cannot be reserved without proper documentation. At that
                point, a friend of mine signaled to one of our legal observers for assistance and
                began recording on her phone. In an attempt to de-escalate the situation, I told the
                police captain that we would not antagonize the rally, while also asserting that we
                had an equal, legal right to the public sidewalk. Perhaps due to the presence of the
                camera and the National Lawyers Guild observers, the police backed away from us, and
                we proceeded to successfully carry out our counterdemonstration. We received several
                signs that debate was not welcome that day; the police captain’s sentiment was
                mirrored in reactions we received from some of the city’s residents, who shouted
                profanities at us as they drove by. Yet the interaction with the city’s police
                department was instructive because it revealed that the act of protest could legally
                continue, even when we had been told that it could not. More importantly, it also
                revealed the need for persistence and for more sustained efforts in organizing for
                Black lives in my hometown.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on this moment in which the police tried to quell our protest with the
                phrase “the debate’s over” has led me to examine the powerful effect that
                antislavery pedagogy has had on my understanding of my own historico-political
                agency. Throughout this essay I will detail my trajectory in engaging with
                antislavery literature and pedagogy, first as an undergraduate student, then as a
                pre-service teacher, and finally as a scholar in the field of education and a social
                justice activist. I will also explain how my ever-shifting relationship with
                antislavery literature and pedagogy—a source of continual intellectual and affective
                debate—has informed my identity, experiences, and civic activity in each of these
                social roles. Overall, I aim to situate my experiences with antislavery curriculum,
                both as a student and as a teacher, within Paulo Freire’s concept of <hi
                    rend="italic">praxis</hi>, or as he defines it, “reflection and action upon the
                world in order to transform it” (<hi rend="italic">Pedagogy,</hi> 51).</p>

                <head>Reading Antislavery Discourse at the Undergraduate Level</head>
            
                    
            <p>My initial contact with antislavery pedagogy began in Professor Joselyn Almeida’s
                “Introduction to British Literature” course when I was a first-year student at the
                University of Massachusetts Amherst. Over the course of the semester, we read the
                work of many prominent abolitionists and other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                authors. For me, the three most powerful readings from this course for realizing my
                own potential for civic action through writing were Ottobah Cugoano’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery</hi> (1787); Mary
                Prince’s <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian Slave, Related
                    by Herself</hi> (1831); and Friedrich Engels’s <hi rend="italic">The Condition
                    of the Working Class in England</hi> (1845). In his fiery exhortation, Cugoano
                forcefully chastises the practice of slavery while simultaneously merging its
                history into that of the developing capitalist economic system. For example, one of
                the central aims of
                <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments </hi>is to locate the
                individuals and corporations who “steal, kidnap, buy, sell, and enslave” other
                humans, or as Cugoano dubs them the “merchandisers of the human species,” into the
                larger economic framework of capitalism, which permits and rewards these cruel and
                exploitative practices (51). In critiquing these “infamous ways of getting rich,”
                Cugoano splices together the despicable history of slavery and that of capitalism
                (70), anticipating the work of scholars such as Eric Williams, Ian Baucom, and
                Walter Mignolo.</p>
                    
            <p>Prince makes a similar point while describing her own experiences working as an
                enslaved person in the salt ponds of the Turks Islands. Prince notes how slave
                owners “received a certain sum for every slave that worked upon [their] premises”
                and how their profits derived from this unpaid labor (10). The force of Prince’s
                autobiography is how she goes on to elaborate the disturbing material conditions and
                details through which slave owners extracted labor from their captives. Furthermore,
                just as Cugoano decried the buying, selling, and merchandising of “the human
                species” for profit, Prince illustrates these horrors through her own personal
                testimony of being offered “for sale like sheep or cattle” (4). Even as her “heart
                throbbed with grief and terror so violently” at the reality of being ripped away
                from her mother and sisters, Prince clearly recognized that for those who bought and
                sold them, tearing apart this family was simply a matter of maximizing their profit
                margin. In other words, for the slave traders who “examined and handled [Prince] in
                the same manner that a butcher would a calf or a lamb he was about to purchase,”
                Prince’s enslavement, the separation of her family, and the sale of her body and
                labor power could be reduced to being “knocked down to the highest bidder” (4).</p>
                    
            <p>Cugoano’s powerful critique of capitalism and Prince’s vivid depiction of the
                conditions of slavery connect with the work of Engels in unexpected ways. Only a
                decade after Prince published her <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, Engels delineates
                the brutal indifference of the ruling class and the relationship between the
                exploitation of the English proletariat and capitalism in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Condition of the Working Class</hi>. For Engels, capitalists can only generate
                profit in the form of surplus value through the “surplus labour” of the proletariat,
                which “costs the capitalist nothing, yet goes into his pocket” (314). Part of the
                power of Engels’s work relies on his depiction of workers with “[knees] bent inward
                and backwards,” “ankles deformed and thick,” “deformities of the pelvis,” and
                inhalation of “excessive dust, powder smoke, carbonic acid gas” (162, 253, 249).
                Although it is indisputable that the English working class were “far better off than
                slaves” (Prince 23), and the atrocious exploitation of the free laborers hardly
                approached the inhuman mistreatment of unfree laborers in all ways, reading Cugoano,
                Prince, and Engels together led me to interrogate the complex relationship between
                unfree labor, free labor, and capitalism unfolding in the nineteenth century.</p>
                    
            <p>This inquiry resulted in a term paper, which challenged me, as a student at the time,
                to reflect on ways I could deploy my writing against oppressive institutions and
                resulted in a more focused independent study with Professor Almeida on free and
                unfree labor. At the outset, the core question guiding the independent study focused
                on the dialectical relationship between the condition of enslaved laborers in the
                Global South (e.g., Cuba and Brazil), the condition of the working class in the
                Global North (e.g., United States and Britain), and capitalism as an international
                politico-economic system. In the syllabus we planned together, I aimed to deepen my
                knowledge of writers from the introductory course as well as to read other
                lesser-known figures, such as Thomas Spence and Robert Wedderburn. In addition, we
                sought to include more contemporary scholarship on the topic of slavery, such as
                texts by C. L. R. James, Eric Williams, David Brion Davis, Sidney Mintz, and David
                Eltis.</p>
                    
            <p>In reading these authors and scholars, it soon became more evident to me that the
                relationship between capitalism and slavery in the nineteenth century encompassed
                what Cugoano acutely established in his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and
                    Sentiments</hi>. It confirmed Karl Marx’s famous assertion in the first volume
                of <hi rend="italic">Capital</hi> (1867) that “the veiled slavery of the
                wage-earners in Europe needed, for its pedestal, slavery pure and simple in the new
                world” (833). It underscored Williams’s revolutionary and groundbreaking proposition
                that the profits of the transatlantic slave trade “fertilized the entire productive
                system of [Britain]” (105). By the end of the independent study, I argued in my term
                paper that capitalism as an economic force not only accommodated transatlantic
                slavery but also shared in a deep-rooted and fundamental relationship with slavery’s
                nineteenth-century development.</p>
                    
            <p>This idea became the basis for my undergraduate honors thesis the following academic
                year. Learning about the field of nineteenth-century antislavery literature led me
                to analyze the structural relationship between capitalism and unfree labor in the
                twenty-first century. To be more precise, I became interested in exploring Marx’s
                (triggering) assertion that not only did “the turning of Africa into a warren for
                the commercial hunting” of Black people signal “the rosy dawn of the era of
                capitalist production” but also his recognition that unfree labor was inextricably
                and structurally intertwined with an economic system whose sole purpose is to “force
                the cost of labor back towards . . . zero” in order to maximize profits (823, 657).
                I wanted to apply my previous research to the project of exposing
                twenty-first-century forms of unfree labor structurally produced by the capitalist
                mode of production. As I examined specific examples of contemporary unfree labor and
                provided readers with direct action steps to advocate for unfree laborers today, I
                began to become more deeply aware of my own historical agency.</p>
                    
            <p>Drawing on the research of modern scholars across numerous disciplines, the three
                major forms of unfree labor in the twenty-first century that I explored in my thesis
                were unfree prison labor, unfree migrant labor, and unfree international labor. By
                reading Angela Davis’s <hi rend="italic">Are Prisons Obsolete?</hi> (2003) alongside
                Michelle Alexander’s <hi rend="italic">The New Jim Crow</hi> (2010) and Dennis
                Childs’s <hi rend="italic">Slaves of the State </hi>(2015), I
                was able to trace the racialized history of prisoners’ economic unfreedom from being
                legally designated as “slaves of the state” via the 1871 Virginia Supreme Court
                decision in <hi rend="italic">Ruffin v. Commonwealth</hi> (as cited by Alexander,
                31) to the hundreds of millions of dollars in profits generated by grossly
                underpaid, predominantly Black and Latinx prison laborers directly or indirectly in
                the production line of the federal government and a vast array of private companies
                including “Dell computers, the Parke­Davis and Upjohn pharmaceutical companies,
                Toys’R’Us, Chevron, IBM, Motorola, Compaq, Texas Instruments, Honeywell, Microsoft,
                Victoria’s Secret, Boeing, Nintendo, and Starbucks,” as well as TransWorld Airlines
                and Honda (Mosher et al. 95). On the topic of unfree migrant laborers, my thesis
                synthesized the research of immigration and slavery scholars Nicholas De Genova,
                Kevin Bales, Ron Soodalter, and Tanya Maria Golash-Boza to elucidate how U.S.
                immigration policy routinely converts already vulnerable migrant laborers into an
                illegal and, therefore, a highly docile and exploitable unfree workforce. For
                instance, one of the main areas of investigation of this portion of my thesis was
                the method through which major corporations like Exxon, John Deere, and Monsanto,
                along with large agribusinesses and the supermarkets and fast-food chains that buy
                from them, could profit from the inexcusable conditions of enslaved, coerced, and
                unpaid labor of migrant workers (Bales and Soodalter 47–8). The last section focused
                on how the structural tendency of capitalism, as embodied by massive multinational
                companies, routinely colludes with governments and financial institutions to produce
                and exploit unfree international workers for the production, accumulation, and
                maximization of surplus value. For example, my explanation of unfree international
                labor directly linked Apple’s 2019 market value of $1.8 trillion (“Apple”) to the
                countless Chinese workers who are reportedly being forced to “hand[le] noxious
                chemicals sometimes without proper gloves or masks” while standing “10 hours a day
                in hot workshops slicing and blasting iPhone casings” (Gao and Webb).</p>
                    
            <p>Ultimately, the overarching claim of my undergraduate honors thesis was that the
                production and exploitation of maximally vulnerable and exploitable unfree laborers
                in the twenty-first century is the result of a structural tendency inextricable from
                the framework of capitalism itself. This structural tendency, or “directing motive,
                the end and aim of capitalist production,” immediately derives from capital’s
                insatiable need to produce, accumulate, and most of all, extract “the greatest
                possible amount of surplus­value,” which is achieved by continuously attempting to
                “force the cost of labor back towards . . . zero” (Marx 363, 657). In my conclusion
                I suggested that capital in the twenty-first century continues to commandeer a
                panoply of state institutions and functions responsible for incarceration,
                immigration, and international trade in order to realize its structural impetus for
                producing, accumulating, and maximizing its share of surplus value.</p>

                The author’s presentation at the Undergraduate Research Conference, UMass Amherst,
                April 2018. &gt;</p>
                    
            <p>Overall, with my focus now shifted toward uncovering and critiquing manifestations of
                slavery today, I soon began to recognize the relationship between my research in
                antislavery literature and the contemporary need to dismantle the political and
                economic institutions continuing to produce unfree laborers. My research and writing
                became a moment for me to link my investigations from the eighteenth and nineteenth
                centuries to our present, while simultaneously exploring ways to discern my place in
                impacting the historical and material conditions of the twenty-first century. At
                this point, I began to experience the way that, as Michel Foucault describes,
                “discourse transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but also undermines and
                exposes it, renders it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it” (101). However,
                in reflecting upon Freire’s notion that “the process of problematization implies a
                critical return to action,” my ambitions in regard to antislavery pedagogy again
                shifted: rather than merely focusing on finishing my thesis, I also developed a
                growing desire to engage in more direct civic action (<hi rend="italic"

            <head>Translating Antislavery Discourse into Action as an
                    Undergraduate</head>
                    
            <p>One of the first methods I explored for participating in civic engagement was
                petitioning the state. The murder of Heather Heyer at the white supremacist “Unite
                the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 moved me to action.
                That year, I started a petition to remove the state of Massachusetts’s only
                Confederate memorial, on Georges Island in Boston Harbor. The importance of
                understanding the history of antislavery movements to the present moment was made
                explicit by the way that white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and many Donald Trump
                supporters had utilized pro-slavery symbols, like Confederate flags and Southern
                Nationalist flags, when they all marched together at the “Unite the Right” rally.
                Since my education had focused on narratives of antislavery from the era of the
                Confederacy, I understood the historical relevance of nationwide protests aimed at
                removing public statues commemorating Confederate soldiers in response to the rise
                of far-right extremism and violence.</p>
                    
            <p>I was also led by my studies to engage with my local and state government in more
                direct modes of action. After my examination of prison labor in my thesis, I began
                drafting public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act and the
                Massachusetts Public Records Law. Even though I always had the legal right and
                capability to issue public records requests, it was only after being inspired by the
                canny ways that nineteenth-century abolitionists manipulated the existing legal
                system to advocate for their antislavery agenda that I began to realize how I might
                put this freedom to best use. I recalled how the various abolitionist societies that
                emerged across England in this period were able to organize unprecedented petitions,
                protests, legal proceedings, and other forms of civic action. For instance, in the
                four weeks following a proposal at the Congress of Vienna to “renew the rights of
                French slave-merchants,” English abolitionists were able to get “a higher proportion
                of the population” to sign antislavery petitions than any other petition of the
                time, including the massively popular Chartist petition of 1848 (Fryer 213). I was
                also profoundly inspired by the work of Granville Sharp, who won the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Somerset v. Stewart</hi> case (1772) that outlawed the forcible
                removal of slaves from England. Sharp also fought vigorously alongside Olaudah
                Equiano and Ottobah Cugoano in the
                <hi rend="italic">Zong </hi>case (1781) to hold accountable the
                slave traders who massacred over 130 enslaved people in order to fraudulently
                collect insurance money.</p>
                    
            <p>Filing public records requests in Massachusetts also allowed me to find more specific
                data regarding the potential collusion between the state, prisons, and capital in
                relation to the production and exploitation of unfree prison laborers. The outcome
                of these records requests revealed that the city of Boston had contracts for prison
                labor, despite the Massachusetts law establishing that “no contract shall be made
                for the labor of prisoners” (M.G.L. Chapter 127, Section 51). I also uncovered the
                fact that prison laborers from the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department were excluded
                from the living-wage agreement that vendors contracting with the city of Boston must
                sign, meaning that there was legally no minimum wage for prison workers contracted
                to the city. In some instances, contracts I obtained through public records requests
                showed how prisoners working through a Massachusetts Department of Correction
                program called “MassCor” earned as little as 40 cents per hour while producing a
                wide range of products, including “certificates, beds, binders, padfolios, clothing,
                decals, embroidered garments, flags, janitorial supplies, mattresses, pillows,
                chairs, desks, and tables, office signs, name tags, street signs, park benches,
                picnic tables, fire pits, bike racks, trash receptacles, engraved wood, brick,
                granite and stone, sheets, and towels” for purchase by both public and private
                entities (MA DOC 3).</p>
                    
            <p>The principles I garnered from reading and analyzing abolitionist and Marxist
                literature also led me toward other avenues for realizing my potential as an agent
                of social change, specifically in the field of education. During the summer of 2016,
                I founded the Peabody Volunteer Tutoring Organization (PVTO), which has since
                partnered with the Peabody public school system to provide free summer tutoring
                every year to hundreds of students ranging from grades one through twelve in
                mathematics, science, English, history, and test preparation. My desire to grant
                students and families of disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds access to the
                additional levels of summer support that have been routinely reserved for their more
                privileged counterparts, and modestly to contribute to an atmosphere of community
                empowerment and solidarity in the city of Peabody, stemmed from my yearning to
                disrupt what the Marxist scholar David Harvey identifies as “accumulation by
                dispossession,” specifically within the realm of public education (<hi rend="italic"
                    >New Imperialism,</hi> 144). With a wide range of scholarship documenting the
                horrific inequities in American schooling from Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Schooling in Capitalist America</hi> (1976) to Jonathan
                Kozol’s <hi rend="italic">Savage Inequalities</hi> (1991) to Pedro Noguera’s
                <hi rend="italic">City Schools and the American Dream </hi>(2003),
                the need for immediate individual and community action to subvert these systems that
                regularly dispossess students of marginalized racial and economic backgrounds of
                access to quality educational experiences became my top priority that summer. For
                me, it was clear that this wide-scale educational inequity was a process deeply
                rooted historically in the rise and expansion of capitalism and the Atlantic slave
                trade.</p>

                        Dispossession in the Classroom</head>
                    
            <p>Upon graduating from UMass Amherst with my bachelor’s degree in English, I began more
                directly to witness the “accumulation by dispossession” process firsthand while
                entering a high-poverty urban school district in western Massachusetts as part of
                the residency portion of my graduate program to earn a master’s degree in the field
                of education. During my time as a pre-service student-teacher in this school, I was
                exposed to the harsh material conditions of education in the United States, a system
                that routinely works to effect the dispossession I described above, which in turn
                limits future economic and social mobility. Before elaborating on the relationship
                between my own undergraduate work and my experiences in this particular school
                district, I will first detail the contexts of student learning in this setting.</p>
                    
            <p>The school itself, formerly a Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance corporate building,
                was located across the street from a brand new MassMutual location. In a stark
                contrast to the $39.2 billion that MassMutual earned in revenue during the previous
                year (“Massachusetts Mutual”) and the statewide median household income of $77,378
                (United States Census), some students attending the school came from neighborhoods
                in which the median annual family income was estimated to be a meager $15,311
                (FFIEC). Moreover, with “segregation along racial, ethnic or other lines” being
                “notoriously pervasive features of all capitalist social formation” (Harvey, <hi
                    rend="italic">Seventeen Contradictions</hi> 68) and “a higher percentage of
                Black children” attending “segregated schools now than in 1968” (Knopp 27), the
                demographics of the school mirrored this reality and were not at all proportional to
                the demographics of the state of Massachusetts. According to data from the state’s
                Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 17.6 percent of students at the
                school identified as African American, 70.8 percent as Hispanic, and 8.5 percent as
                white (MA DESE). For purposes of comparison, 71.1 percent of all residents in the
                state of Massachusetts identify as white (United States Census). In other words,
                compared to the rest of the state, the school was clearly segregated along lines of
                race and class, despite the <hi rend="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</hi>
                (1953) Supreme Court ruling declaring that “separate educational facilities are
                inherently unequal” nearly seventy years before (Warren 495).</p>
                    
            <p>The staff of this school wielded a disproportionate amount of power over students.
                The teachers and administrators were mostly white and of upper-middle-class
                backgrounds, making it clear to me that this school was the embodiment of what
                linguist Mary Louise Pratt identifies as a “contact zone,” or a social space “where
                cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly
                asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths
                as they are lived out in many parts of the world today” (34). As a student with a
                background in antislavery and resistance pedagogy, entering this contradictory
                contact zone as a pre-service teacher meant that I understood I had the potential to
                either “reproduce socioeconomic and racial inequalities” or “[build] critical
                consciousness . . . and revolutionary resistance” (Au 90). This awareness led me to
                design a pedagogical unit that aimed to dismantle one particular instance of a
                racialized and classist school policy harming my new students: the school dress
                code.</p>
                    
            <p>The district’s dress code policy, which banned any article of clothing with a hood,
                was firmly entrenched in a history of anti-Black and anti-Brown racism in the United
                States. Under the guise of promoting public safety, Black and Brown children were
                being targeted. The underlying logic maintaining the dress code policy was the
                misguided and racist belief that these children are more dangerous than other
                children and therefore should not be allowed to wear anything that could potentially
                conceal their identities in schools. Ideologically, this was the same belief system
                that allowed the murderer of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black
                student, to be found innocent of second-degree murder and even of the lesser charge
                of manslaughter (Alvaraz and Buckley). In practice, the enforcement of the
                district’s dress code meant that the school’s predominantly white teachers and
                administrators would waste valuable class time stripping Black and Brown students of
                their winter clothing, whether a hoody or a hooded jacket or coat. I can vividly
                recall sitting in the back of a math class when the school’s principal halted the
                lesson by entering the room with a grocery cart and making students take off their
                jackets one by one and put them in the cart. After the principal left, I remember
                watching one student shivering at his desk in a T-shirt for the remainder of class.
                On another cold fall morning, I heard an assistant principal boast in the hallway
                how he “snagged another one,” referring to a student’s hoody. On this particular
                day, it was so cold that it hurt my hands to type: how must the student have been
                feeling, without his sweater? More shockingly, the enforcement of the dress code
                continued all through the harsh New England winter, even as outdoor temperatures
                fell well below zero and even as some of the school’s defective HVAC systems blasted
                freezing outdoor air directly into classrooms.</p>

                The school’s hoody cart&gt;</p>
                    
                    
            <p>The racialized, institutional violence and dispossession that the school’s dress code
                inflicted on my new students prompted me to consider ways I could leverage my
                curriculum to ignite student-based civic action. More specifically, after reflecting
                on the potential power that petitioning against and publicly exposing injustice had,
                I decided to base my “Persuasive Writing” unit on changing the dress code.
                Throughout the course of the unit, students composed argumentative letters addressed
                to the district’s school committee. I also wanted students to use these letters to
                participate in a speak-out event that the school committee had planned in the spring
                of that school year to publicly reveal the true and disturbing reality of the dress
                code policy. Working with students to write these letters was by far one of the most
                transformative experiences in my career as a teacher. In an approach that was based
                on synthesizing research and their specific day-to-day material conditions, my
                students wrote cogent and powerful arguments for why the dress code should be
                changed.</p>
                    
            <p>It came as no great surprise that these arguments were quickly censored by the
                school’s administrators. When they learned that I was working with students to
                present our case to the school committee, a number of administrators visited my
                classroom with the aim of disrupting our plan to disseminate the letters. My
                students were falsely told that their constitutional right to freedom of speech and
                expression could not be exercised at a school-run event. Although this was counter
                to the 1969 <hi rend="italic">Tinker v. Des Moines</hi> Supreme Court decision that
                established that neither “students [nor] teachers shed their constitutional rights
                to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate” (Fortas 506), my
                students were legitimately afraid to say anything that might upset the school’s
                administration, especially because it was common practice to detain students through
                in-school suspension for even very minor violations of school policy. For myself, I
                remember being told in no uncertain terms that being vocal about this issue could
                potentially impact my future career prospects as an educator because “principals and
                superintendents talk.”</p>
                    
            <p>In the end, we were unable to send the letters. But despite this repression of
                student and teacher resistance, the instructional unit still had a tremendous impact
                on my students’ historical and political conceptions of themselves. In a post-unit
                reflection, one of my students wrote: “Having gone through this unit, I would want
                you to teach your future students this lesson. You taught us that we must stand up
                against the people of power and that it’s wrong for them to be holding us back. This
                lesson taught me that we have rights that are being taken away and changed just
                because the color of our skin and because [of] our ages. You told us to fight

                            to share his response.</note> Overall, my students’ powerful
                remarks indicated that the unit succeeded in promoting their awareness of their
                historical agency and capacity for civic action. By the end of the unit, students
                recognized that there will always be pathways for resistance and subversion and that
                they must always continue fighting for their rights regardless of the systemic
                barriers that powerful institutions will leverage against them. Students also
                learned that the power of social change begins and is sustained through collective
                civic action. In short, my unit was able to teach students the core values I
                internalized from studying antislavery pedagogy, all through the framework of a
                curriculum of praxis.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding experiences that could have derailed me from the path toward becoming
                an educator, the lesson of resilience allows me to conclude this essay with a
                reflection on what I have learned in my latest role as a teacher in the city of
                Revere, Massachusetts, alongside my continuing role as a social justice activist in
                Peabody. After the murder of George Floyd, a few colleagues and I formed a community
                organization called “Peabody for Social Justice.” Our main focus has been raising
                awareness of the ways through which the United States systematically attacks the
                lives of Black Americans and people of color, whether through the militant policing
                of Black and Latinx neighborhoods, the chronic underfunding of public education
                systems that primarily serve students of color, the perpetuation of racialized and
                class-based inequities in the healthcare industry, the unfair criminalization and
                imprisonment of people of color, the grotesque exploitation of workers in
                predominantly Black and Brown communities, or by any other means. In the words of
                our mission statement, we seek to “promote the values of liberty, equality, and
                justice for all in our city, regardless of any individual’s race, ethnicity,
                religion, cultural background, linguistic background, gender, sexuality, ability,
                economic class, immigration status, or nationality.” To achieve this goal, we began
                by leading a series of antiracism and anti–police brutality protests and rallies
                across our predominantly white, middle-class suburban city. Next, we were able to
                arrange a meeting with the city’s mayor to discuss more concrete and long-term
                political changes to make Peabody more equitable and socially just. Some of the
                activities we proposed included conducting thorough reviews of city policies,
                ordinances, and services for race- or class-based biases; collecting and publishing
                data regarding the day-to-day operations of city institutions; and organizing
                rallies and other events to promote the need for social justice.</p>
                    
            <p>In the spring of 2020, activists in Boston beheaded the statue of Christopher
                Columbus that faced the waterfront in the city’s North End. Such events demonstrate
                that the ongoing wave of civic action across the United States can be clearly traced
                back to the continuous work of fighting against the legacy of slavery and
                contemporary manifestations of white supremacy. When I returned to school after my
                summer of activism, I continued to develop more robust civically-motivated lessons
                and antiracist curricula to spark my students’ understanding of their own historical
                agency. For example, one instructional unit I devised asked students to investigate
                and analyze current Massachusetts legislation that involves the rights of
                marginalized socioeconomic groups and learn how they can fight for social change at
                the state level by lobbying their elected officials. I also continue to support
                students by incorporating the skills I learned from my early activism to help them
                lobby for political changes that
                <hi rend="italic">they </hi>want to see in the city, state, and
                beyond. In alignment with the principles of antislavery pedagogy and Freire’s theory
                of praxis, I expect my students to utilize their ability to read, analyze, and
                produce sustained discourse to influence social change, as well as participate in
                more physical events of civic action.</p>
                    
            <p>Now more than ever, we must embrace this emancipatory praxis promulgated by Freire.
                As critical educators, we are constantly reminded that our roles and
                responsibilities to our students extend far beyond the dominant “banking” concept of
                education, through which “the students are the depositories [of knowledge] and the
                teacher is the depositor” (Freire, <hi rend="italic">Pedagogy</hi> 72). Instead, we
                must actively encourage students critically to examine the structures of power and
                exploitation in their surrounding material conditions. By consistently integrating
                theory and praxis in the classroom and offering students alternative visions of the
                future, we can tap into their emerging conceptions of justice, equality, and
                fairness. In my classroom, this looks like students conducting individually led,
                sustained-action research projects based on social justice issues related to the
                course’s theoretical frameworks.</p>
                    
            <p>One project that encapsulates these ideas is the final project for my “World
                Revolutions” unit. After students have learned about the conditions, beliefs, and
                triggers of some of the world’s most significant revolutions, I ask them to research
                a country or place they believe is ripe for a revolution today. In this project,
                students are invited to integrate their understanding of the social, political, and
                economic causes of earlier revolutions with the current historical moment. Rather
                than acting as a “depositor” of information, my role in the classroom is to
                facilitate, challenge, and offer support as students explore the material conditions
                of the past and present and the various theoretical frameworks for interrogating it,
                such as Cugoano, Engels, Marx, Prince, Williams, and others. Through self-directed,
                sustained-inquiry projects like the ones I’ve described, we can ignite students’
                passion for a better world, a world free of slavery, exploitation, and oppression.
                As the story of my experiences with antislavery pedagogy demonstrates, it was
                ultimately this kind of undertaking at various stages of my development that guided
                and critically informed my trajectory from student to researcher to educator to
                social activist and back.</p>
                    
            <p>Although the challenges and institutional powers before us today in the twenty-first
                century are unprecedented and complex, we cannot forget the historical importance of
                the spirit of resilience to the project of abolition and social justice. As Cugoano
                wrote:
            <quote>This must appear evident, that for any man to carry on a traffic in the merchandize
                of slaves, and to keep them in slavery; or for any nation to oppress, extirpate and
                destroy others; that these are crimes of the greatest magnitude, and a most daring
                violation of the laws and commandments of the Most High, and which, at last, will be
                evidenced in the destruction and overthrow of all the transgressors. And nothing
                else can be expected for such violations of taking away the natural rights and
                liberties of men. (61)</quote>
                
            The abolitionists of the nineteenth century were up against some of the most
                powerful, vicious, and despicable institutions of modern human history. Yet in their
                fight against the transatlantic slave trade—the cradle of capitalism and present-day
                neo-slavery—the abolitionists, radicals, and revolutionaries never ceased to
                envision a world in which transgressors were overthrown and the rights and liberties
                of all people were upheld. Antislavery pedagogy in the era of Black Lives Matter
                reminds us of the work that we must do to keep ourselves united and organized to
                promote freedom and equality for all. Claiming our own historical agency and the
                field for civic action means insisting that debate must persist, even when
                authorities tell us it cannot.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p> In my essay-response “Emergent,” I engage with the essays in Romantic Circles' volume Romanticism and Anti-Slavery Literatures: Pedagogies and 
                   Contexts, responding to contributions from Patricia Matthews, Elizabeth Fay, Sean Gordon, Fran Botkin, Ivan Ortiz, Nicolas Blaisdell, and others. 
                   Drawing on adrienne maree brown's Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds (2017), I explore how Romantic studies can facilitate decentralized, 
                   intentional change. In my essay, I also weave in Kathleen Stewart’s concept of emergence from Ordinary Affects (2007), focusing on the fragmented, heightened 
                   moments of everyday experience. Structured as an index, “Emergent” mirrors the fragmented and shifting nature of the immediate, enacting the theoretical 
                   framework it advocates. This form allows for a dynamic response to the themes of anti-slavery, pedagogy, and Romanticism discussed in the volume, fostering 
                   an emergent, reflective approach to scholarly work. By embracing small-scale, localized actions and personal experiences, I argue for the transformative 
                   potential within Romantic studies that aligns with the collective, yet individual, endeavors of the volume’s contributors.</p>

            <p>I like the word: emerge. What it conjures: Motion. Risk-taking. Ideas on the verge. </p>
                
            <p>adrienne maree brown wasn’t the first to highlight emergence for me, but her 2017
                book <hi rend="italic">Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds</hi>
                rooted me in the concept’s importance to teaching, writing, and being in these
                charged times. Emergent strategy originated as a business model in the 1970s meaning
                “a pattern of action that develops over time in an organization in the absence of a
                specific mission and goals, or despite a mission and goals” (Rivera). brown says
                that her engagement with the concept began with her reading of Black science-fiction
                author Octavia Butler’s notion of change as small, decentralized, and intentional.
                In brown’s introduction to “intentional adaptation,” she quotes Butler: “We are
                Earthseed / The life that perceives itself Changing” (46). From there, brown grew
                the idea to describe myriad forms of brokenness and transformation needed for a more
                just world.</p>
                
            <p>“Emergent” also aptly describes the pedagogical interventions in this volume, where
                scholar-teachers take risks and adapt as they develop new curriculums, such as
                Frances Botkin’s adaptation of the resourceful practice of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tunyuhan</hi>. The word, Botkin tells us, comes from a Jamaican proverb:
                “tunyuhan (turn your hand) and mek (make) fashion,” or “make the best use of any
                available resources to create something new.” Or Ivan Ortiz’s evocation of literary
                séance to make Black voices audible. Ortiz uses texts as mediums and mediations,
                especially those that crack open history, like M. NourbeSe Philip’s
                <hi rend="italic">Zong! </hi>(2008) poems broken across pages
                and centuries. There is also Elizabeth Fay’s emphasis on the violent movement of
                bodies and selves across the Atlantic, as well as Nicholas Blaisdell’s ability to
                link eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholarship “to our present.” And Sean
                Gordon’s amplification of “dehiscence,” a practice described by Fred Moten as a
                Black studies “emergent poetics” (1743).</p>
                
            <p>Clearly, these examples show how an emergent strategy can vitalize the teaching of
                Romantic literature in 2025 and beyond. In the years before I read brown, I was
                drawn to anthropologist Kathleen Stewart’s idea of emergence, aligned with the
                changes in my scholarly work and my teaching some years ago. In her 2007 book <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordinary Affects</hi>, Stewart wrote about the “emergent present,”
                the shifting, fragmented, heightened moments of the everyday. Her book indexes
                potent encounters that we can’t quite categorize, intimate moments that merge with
                public issues and then evaporate like a mist only to reappear later in another form.
                Such moments, she says, “will shift people’s life trajectories in some small way,
                change them by literally changing their course for a minute or a day” (12). More
                often than not, I will add, emergent moments transform us as they remake the ghostly
                past in the embodied present.</p>

            <head>Emergent: as fragment;</head>
                
            <p>In June 2013, I was at a house party in Chicago’s Belmont district, mingling with
                people in a leafy backyard. These were people I didn’t see at my university,
                founders of arts programs and alternative newspapers and activist organizations. A
                little Scotty dog dashed around. Everyone except me knew his name. The guests, hip
                and creative, wore mismatched stockings and skirts, asymmetrical hemlines, and
                bright earrings. They seemed cool, and I wanted to join in, but when I edged into a
                circle, people spoke past me. Hot dampness hung in the air, evoking a longing
                feeling, an ache for the experiences I didn’t have with these people but which they
                had with one another.</p>
                
            <p>The yard was crowded and sweaty, and I moved inside. Only one other person sat in the
                dimly lit living room where a melancholy tune of trombones and violins played. I
                drifted over and sat next to Marvin, as he later introduced himself. He raised his
                beer and smiled. The heat inside was suffocating yet Marvin wore a long black
                leather jacket and bowler cap, as if he’d come from a distant country where it was
                always cold. I didn’t want to bring up the weather because my eyes kept drifting to
                his cap, so I asked where he worked. “I don’t work now,” he said. There was
                something about this party that suppressed my normal social instincts. In any other
                context I would have talked about my job and family. But all I seemed to be able to
                do was listen.</p>
                
            <p>While Black and white people mingled outside, inside Marvin and I connected over
                parenting. I noticed he had a way of smiling that seemed new, as if he’d just
                rediscovered those muscles around his mouth. He told me how his daughter grew up
                while he was locked up, how he was getting to know her for the first time. He’d had
                a hard time finding a job since he got out of prison, he said. It was hard when
                you’d been in prison for so long. You had to toughen yourself up, and that made you
                awkward around people. He rubbed his eyebrow shyly. He had just bought his daughter
                a house with the compensation he received for being wrongfully accused.</p>
                
            <p>I thought of my own daughter as Marvin talked. She and I were estranged at the time.
                I had desperately tried to contact her to no avail. Forced alienation from a
                daughter, one of the deepest human hurts—it was a feeling I could touch. But as I
                looked into Marvin’s intense eyes, my internal screen went blank. How could I know
                wrongful conviction and forced separation from a child, from an entire family, in
                the context of the experience he related to me? I couldn’t. But he was telling me
                his story, and I listened.</p>

            <div type="section">
            <head>Emergent: and the Romantic period;</head>
                
            <p>One of the most striking features of this volume is how the pastness of the British
                slave trade, abolition, and emancipation emerge in current poems, novels, plays,
                songs, and movies, across the internet, on the streets, and, crucially, within
                schools and classrooms. Patricia A. Matthew acknowledges that although early
                abolitionist texts are not “documentaries that teach us about the past,” they can
                speak to current race issues. Her students discuss slavery and abolition at a
                historic and geographic remove and yet feel the issues press closely on their lives
                as they learn to adapt one era’s practices to their own.</p>
                
            <p>Adaptation is central to Botkin’s method as well. She puts Marlon James’s
                contemporary novel <hi rend="italic">The Book of Night Women</hi> (2009) in dialogue
                with Romantic literature. James’s dizzying historical remix, Botkin says, features
                graphic scenes of trauma, which unsettle what students think they know about
                enslavement. At the same time, it informs their current experience. Likewise, Fay
                reveals that for her students, the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 gave writers
                like Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince “a new legitimacy” unheard of in previous
                generations of students. And Gordon, in an “Ethnic American Literature” course he
                designed in 2015, boldly led students to question their assumptions about “the
                ‘pastness’ of slavery, the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative
                postracialism of the Obama administration.”</p>
                
            <p>Surely my conversation with Marvin held so much import for me because of how the past
                emerged in the present. For twelve of the years Marvin was in prison, I spent almost
                every waking moment steeped in literature of the slave trade, abolition, and
                emancipation during the British Romantic period. I wrote about that history in neat
                explications, complete with historical contexts and pages of citations, and bound in
                scholarly journals and books. But it was only when I stepped away from literary
                criticism and all I had learned that the meaning of that awful history started to
                emerge in a different way, rushing into my life in fleeting, transitory moments,
                informing and complicating the present. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery
                with one major exception: slavery remained appropriate punishment for a crime. The
                Virginia Supreme Court defined convicts as synonymous with enslaved people.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Thanks to my

            <head>Emergent: as signifying;</head>
                
            <p>I set upon the topic of the slave trade, abolition, and emancipation through a chance
                encounter with Henry Louis Gates Jr., when I was a meek graduate student at the
                University of Arizona. I had read Gates’s book <hi rend="italic">The Signifying
                    Monkey</hi> (1988), which had recently come out, and
                <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave </hi>(1831)
                in a postcolonial literature course, and was excited that he was giving a talk at
                the university. Gates spoke about race and the literary canon and about recovering
                texts written by formerly enslaved men and women. There was a dinner after the talk,
                and to my astonishment, I ended up seated elbow-to-elbow with the great scholar with
                the smiling eyes. He was casual and friendly, fluffing out his napkin and pouring me
                a glass of water before filling his own.</p>
                
            <p>In my time as a graduate student, I’d never read anything like <hi rend="italic">The
                    Signifying Monkey.</hi> I still recall being mesmerized by how Gates harnessed
                the African American vernacular tradition and the double-voiced Yoruba trickster Esu
                to develop the “signifyin’ figure” who danced through the pages of African American
                literature. “To rename is to revise,” Gates wrote, “and to revise is to Signify”
                (xxiii). Revise the method for my project, and maybe even shift the canon a bit, was
                what I wanted to do. The book emerged from the hundreds of others on my Ph.D.
                reading lists, not just because of Gates’s ideas, brilliant as they were, but
                because of how he himself had written a scholarly work so alive, multiplicious, and
                full of intellectual trickery. It struck me as, well, not entirely academic in
                style. How did he do it?</p>
                
            <p>In my eyes Gates may as well have been a movie star (and he would go on to become a
                TV celebrity and witness in free speech court proceedings). I was too nervous to
                utter a word, so I just stared at his nice old-fashioned wristwatch that fit the
                persona of someone with schedules to keep. But Gates must have asked what I was
                working on, because I distinctly remember telling him, in a stumbling monologue full
                of ums and ahs, about Romantic literature and how only a shred of scholarship about
                the slave trade and abolition had been produced. I had pored over Eva Beatrice
                Dyke’s 1942
                book <hi rend="italic">The Negro in English Romantic Thought</hi>.
                I had attended Alan Richardson’s 1990 MLA panel. I was drawn to the topic, I told
                him, but I confessed my worry. As a non-Black person, did I have a right to pursue
                this research? Was it my story to tell? Perhaps I was also afraid to confront the
                culpability of my own European ancestry.</p>
                
            <p>Gates’s eyes grew serious through huge glasses resting on his cheeks. “Absolutely!”
                he said. I must “absolutely choose this topic” for my dissertation. Was I going to
                the archive? Texts, voices, needed to be brought to light. Though my work might
                never “signify,” I understood, it could have significance. Or maybe, as a white
                woman writing about the atrocities of Europeans, my work could signify on early
                white men and women.</p>

            <div type="section">
            <head>Emergent: and police violence;</head>
                
            <p>A few months after I met Marvin, I had lunch with Alice, the woman who had hosted the
                house party. I told her about my conversation with Marvin. Though the conversation
                had lasted an hour at most, he kept surfacing in my thoughts. Was he okay? What had
                happened?</p>
                
            <p>Chicago cops were the worst, Alice said through frowning eyes and pursed lips as she
                told me his story. Some twenty years earlier, two women and three children were
                found dead in what appeared to be a house fire. The police questioned suspects, and
                their evidence suggested a family member had committed the murders and started the
                fire as a cover up. Instead of pursuing that lead, the police arrested two innocent
                men, Marvin and another man, Ronald Kitchen, who happened to live nearby.</p>
                
            <p>Alice pointed me to some online articles, and I later found more on my own.<note place="foot" resp="author">See
                            especially Baer’s recent <hi rend="italic">Beyond the Usual Beating</hi>
                            (2021).</note> Marvin and Ronald’s injustice started with
                Chicago police detective and commander Jon Burge, who spent eighteen years leading a
                campaign against innocent Black men. Before his crimes were exposed in 1990, Burge
                targeted some two hundred Black men, torturing, imprisoning, and killing many of
                them for crimes they did not commit. Burge had learned his craft in the Army during
                the Korean War, first as a military policeman and then in combat, facing a foe of a
                different race (Conroy). Burge unleashed his crimes unchallenged and even received
                numerous honors, including a Bronze Star. Today his career stands as one of the most
                egregious examples of serial police violence against Black men in U.S. history.</p>
                
            <p>When Marvin was exonerated in 2009, media stories emerged. In an interview with
                Marlene Martin of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, Marvin told how police
                broke down the door to his sister’s house, kidnapped him, and then beat him. I felt
                the intensity of the injustice when, in the interview, Marvin related tender stories
                of his formative years growing up in a housing project. Though the buildings are now
                gone, he recalled a courtyard of flowers where he used to hang out. His favorite
                memory was a camping trip. A local pastor had organized the trip for him and a bunch
                of neighborhood kids. “He made sure we went on this weekend camping trip to show us
                another side of life,” Marvin said. “I’ll never forget that—it made such an
                impression on me” (Martin).</p>
                
            <p>I’ll never forget how at the lunch meeting, when I mentioned Marvin’s name, Alice
                smiled so wide, the lines around her eyes sprawled across her temples and down the
                sides of her face. Her face drew me in like a force. She nodded and peeked
                cautiously from over her glasses, as if the thought of him gave her a feeling of
                deep fondness with agony mixed in. Even after we parted, her expression appeared
                before me, slowly gathering resonance rather than settling something.</p>

            <p>The authors of the essays in this volume rightly champion firsthand accounts. Fay
                argues that “for some students of color . . . firsthand accounts can be empowering.”
                Ortiz shows how ballads are oral forms migrated to print, and how these forms now
                act as mediums for Black voices. Yet even in canonical literary works by non-Black
                writers, Black voices can be heard, as Toni Morrison points out in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Playing in the Dark</hi> (1992), giving expression to “social decay and
                economic division” of white culture (63).</p>
                
            <p>I spent what felt like a lifetime examining the documents of British antislavery,
                following trails, uncovering metaphors, reading works by mostly non-Black
                authors—the court cases, the tracts and polemics, the debates, the newspaper
                articles, the dubious scientific theories, the iconography, the mounds of
                antislavery poetry and plays and novels, and the thousands of travel texts. I was
                tireless in my research, mesmerized by how one source led to another and then
                another, by the physical act of filling out the request forms in the British

            <p>I remember the feeling of heaviness created by the sheer number of documents in dark
                rooms guarded by stone-faced librarians, and I often fell ill thinking about how
                antislavery writings and contemporary literary theory rarely let the people taken
                from Africa or born into the system of enslavement speak for themselves.<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Saidiya
                            Hartman keenly observes in “Venus in Two Acts,” the archive of slavery
                            is a scandalous place where “infelicitous speech, obscene utterances,
                            and perilous commands give birth to the characters we stumble upon in
                            the archive. Given the condition in which we find them, the only
                            certainty is that we will lose them again, that they will expire or
                            elude our grasp or collapse under the pressure of inquiry”
                        (6).</note> I became increasingly concerned with finding those
                voices, even if they were often mediated through white institutions and scribes. I
                read the letters of the Sierra Leone settlers, which were scattered in libraries
                across England and the United States. In one collection, I stumbled upon a small
                account of enslaved women—mothers and daughters—wresting control of a plantation. In
                London a series of slave complaints emerged from the House of Commons Parliamentary
                papers dating to 1816. In select colonies including Berbice and Demerara, as I
                learned, the enslaved could report abuses to a British officer—called a “Fiscal”—who
                took down their words and filed them with the House of Commons. These complaints
                highlight aspects of Black culture hidden from most other accounts. I learned about
                working conditions, living quarters, the amount of food, clothing, and other
                supplies people had access to, and about their resistances and rebellions.</p>
                
            <p>One afternoon in the British Library I found myself reading the account of Tommy, a
                story that stays with me to this day:
                
            <quote>"February 19, 1819. Negro Tommy, belonging to William Fraser: —Says, he is a cooper by
                trade, and employed as such by his master on plantation Goldstone Hall; that on
                Friday morning last he went in the boiling-house for nails, and there saw another
                cooper heading up sugars; Tommy went to one of the casks and took a lump of sugar
                for the purpose of sweetening three gallons of hot water; did not hide the same, but
                proceeded with it in his hand from the boiling-house; was met by his master, Mr.
                Fraser, who inquired where he got the sugar, Tommy informed him of his having taken
                it, and for what purpose, his master immediately ordered him to be laid down, tied
                to stakes, put two drivers over him, and one hundred lashes inflicted upon him. Mr.
                Fraser went to Tommy’s house and searched it, found in his tool chest a quantity of
                old nails, among which were also a very few new ones; Mr. Fraser went to the trouble
                of weighing them, there were fourteen pounds."<note

                            (337–40). I’m especially grateful to Richardson for his pioneering work
                            on antislavery and Black writers during the Romantic period and for
                            mentoring me during my career.</note></quote>
                
            It took years for me to unravel the meaning of this testimony. Tommy’s actions
                replayed in my imagination until I saw his self-determination in every word of his
                complaint. By stealing sugar—the product of his own labor—Tommy was subverting
                capitalism, which slave labor made possible. Subverting but also using. By
                collecting a great quantity of nails, Tommy was exploiting capitalism. The fact that
                Fraser weighed the nails implies that he suspected Tommy was selling them.</p>
                
            <p>The account continues beyond the segment I’ve included here. In it, Tommy complains
                of not enough food and clothing, and of being harassed by Fraser, but his primary
                objection is the hundred lashes, when the legal limit was forty-one. The court
                interviewed various witnesses, each claiming Tommy received a different number of
                lashes. Finally, the court asked Tommy to “exhibit his posterior,” and he had very
                little sign of being lashed. Tommy explains: “I was favored by the drivers who threw
                the whips over me.”</p>
                
            <p>Between the lines, I saw, Tommy was complaining to the court about harassment and
                torture, but he was also announcing agency over the plantation system. When he said
                he was favored by the drivers, he was issuing a warning. Drivers were enslaved men
                who received larger food and clothing rations. They commanded other enslaved people,
                which made it dangerous for planters to upset a driver’s authority once it was
                established. Drivers could be mediators, cops, or potential rebel leaders.</p>
                
            <p>For me, what mattered most about Tommy’s story was how his firsthand account bubbled
                up through the testimony recorded by colonists. Although, at first glance, the
                court’s order for Tommy to remove his clothing might seem degrading, it also offered
                Tommy a chance to reveal how he has been able to retain his agency. Tommy proved how
                the drivers favored him by “exhibiting his posterior.” With that act, he was
                literally mooning them (and mooning is a word and concept dating back to 1600).
                “Kiss my ass,” he was saying. Most importantly, although Tommy was probably
                illiterate, he staged his action in a way that would be recorded in the colonial
                discourse for centuries to come. In other words, by showing the court his backside
                and letting them know he wasn’t powerless, he was signifying on the institution that
                sought to oppress him.</p>

            <head>Emergent; as geometry;</head>
                
            <p>My years of research across continents piecing together Britain’s antislavery project
                and searching for voices like Tommy’s and listening to stories like Marvin’s changed
                me. At Washington State University, I taught entire courses on the subject,
                highlighting the rebellions and revolutions in Jamaica, Saint Domingue, and
                elsewhere, as well as the many ways the enslaved survived, resisted, and overturned.
                I stood over photocopy machines and heavy-duty staplers creating handmade booklets
                for my students of these defiant texts. In the geometry of my classroom, we gathered
                in a perfect circle and read them aloud. As students took the words inside their
                bodies and made them live, we heard power shift from the institution of slavery to a
                group of Black women taking charge of a plantation or to a household servant
                poisoning an abusive white man.</p>
                
            <p>But my old-school ways were not nearly as inventive as the methods adopted in this
                volume. Methods like Botkin’s Zoom dialogue with Maroons or Fay’s triangulations, a
                practice she adapted from nautical strategy and scholar Christina Sharpe. Blaisdell
                also triangulates his work—reading Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, and Friedrich
                Engels together helps him understand the relationship between nineteenth-century
                problems of unfree labor, free labor, and capitalism.</p>
                
            <p>“Emergence,” brown writes, “is our inheritance as a part of this universe; it is how
                we change” (3). She consults nature for lessons on teaching, organizing, and taking
                care of one another and oneself: birds flocking, earthworms burrowing, leaves
                decaying, roots going deep offer different instructions. But one of nature’s most
                fascinating forms—the fractal—is for brown the geometry of transformation. “What we
                practice at a small scale can reverberate to the largest scale,” she reminds us
                (42). I found this self-similar, iterative process evident across the essays of this
                volume, each piece unfolding like an offering for how to teach an abolitionist
                Romanticism.</p>

            <head>Emergent: and abolition;</head>
                
            <p>A few years ago, I read a review by Carvell Wallace in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                    Times</hi> of “The Good Lord Bird,” a TV miniseries about the nineteenth-century
                American abolitionist John Brown, produced by Ethan Hawke. “Can a white person ever
                usefully tell a slave story,” Wallace asked, “or, more specifically, can they tell a
                story that is useful to the descendants of the enslaved, rather than to their own
                egos or cinematic fantasies?”</p>
                
            <p>I felt a bright sting. Though the great Henry Louis Gates Jr. had once encouraged me
                to tell the stories of Black lives, I continue to wonder—can I? I sometimes doubt my
                ability to write about the stories of enslaved people by Romantic-era authors. I
                decided I would not watch the series.</p>
                
            <p>Yet I kept returning to the fact that abolition and enslaved people were the most
                pressing topic of the British Romantic period. At the time I started my research and
                writing, nothing could have been clearer to me. Several authors in this collection
                cite Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s sermon on abolition in 1795 on the steps of the
                Bristol docks in the heart of that city’s slave business; Equiano’s and Cugoano’s
                fierce agitation for abolition; and Prince’s narrative told to the London
                Anti-Slavery Society. Not to mention the millions of pages of antislavery writings
                by Black and white activist men and women.</p>
                
            <p>Antislavery was pursued with such intensity, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to find
                abolition, albeit much transformed since the Romantic period, emergent among some
                young activists today. Syrus Marcus Ware, a transgender scholar and artist, urges
                academics, writers, poets, activists, performers—everyone—to “approach abolition as
                the most loving thing that we can do for one another” (Ware). Last year I attended
                Ware’s workshop on abolition, in which participants listened to Angela Davis while
                we imagined futures full of love and freedom and justice. As Petra Kuppers, the
                workshop organizer, put it:
                
            <quote>This personal sensation of a white cis queer disabled woman feels far away from the
                project of ending slavery’s long reach, I know, and I feel immediately the concern
                of projecting my own sense of unfreedom, being denied access to my range-giving
                wheelchair, onto the experiences of people racialized as Black. But that’s what
                Syrus is offering to me here: charting my experience, my sense, from wherever I come
                from. Grounding a sense of justice in a personal felt, lived experience, in
                connection. So I let it stand, that moment of loosening the armor, and I touch into
                it to be present. (Kuppers)</quote>
                
            The experience was visceral, uncomfortable, on the verge of something new for many of
                the participants.</p>
                
            <p>Many of the teacher-scholars in this volume embrace abolition. I see a wonderful,
                complementary rhythm between Ortiz’s call to listen to Romantic “sounds we would
                otherwise block out because they are too raucous, inarticulate, or inconvenient” and
                Ware’s invitation to embody the sounds of a world rooted in liberation and
                self-determination. I’m moved by Matthew’s account of how when students learn an
                “abolitionist Romanticism” they are also learning “about the intricacies of society,
                protest, and revolution.” As Alan Richardson observes in his response here, I too am
                heartened by Blaisdell’s report of being inspired by Granville Sharp working
                shoulder-to-shoulder with Equiano and Cugoano. Such collaborative abolitionism
                prompted Blaisdell to found a community tutoring center. Reading about his actions
                also brought to mind Ware’s words: The “abolitionist struggle . . . is 500 years
                strong,” he writes, and “now is a time to reflect on the history of the abolition
                movement and what the future could look like if we reach abolition in our lifetime”
                (Ware).</p>
                
            <p>I’ve also understood that the backward glances, missteps, doubts, and mistakes I make
                when writing and speaking about abolition are part of the fractal nature of
                learning. Shortly after I read the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> review about “The
                Good Lord Bird,” one of my African American students who writes eloquently about
                <hi rend="italic">The History of Mary Prince </hi>called me by
                Zoom and said, completely unsolicited, “You should watch that series!” The
                coincidence captured meant I had to respond.
                
            <quote>
                <p>“But can a white person really tell that story?” I told her about the review.</p>
            <p>She shrugged. “Different people have different views,” she said. “I like it.”</p>

            <p>“What does it mean to function as a group in a changing environment?” asks Alexis
                Pauline Gumbs in <hi rend="italic">Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine
                    Animals</hi> (2020), part of the Emergent Strategy series (51). Gumbs consults
                sea life, animals adept at fluidity, for teachable moments and parallels to the
                current work of abolition. Mothering and gathering in super pods are dolphin
                strategies just as communities of care and cooperatives have been part of the Black
                Diaspora for centuries.</p>
                
            <p>Caregiving. Collectivity. These ancient principles are emergent in this volume’s
                classroom practices. For instance, the way Matthew begins her courses with “a
                conversation about the various ways civic groups try to effect broad change and a
                low-stakes free-association exercise about the word <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi>.”
                The way Gordon encourages crosstalk by assigning student support groups for writing
                and responding. How Blaisdell had his students enact a letter-writing campaign
                against unjust school dress codes, where they learned “that the power of social
                change begins and is sustained through collective civic action.” And how MaMa G, the
                elder featured in Botkin’s essay, envisions opening a “borderless university,”
                rooted in Jamaica but developed online, to unite local and global communities in the
                growth and dissemination of Indigenous knowledge.</p>
                
            <p>Young Black feminist theorists and embodiment scholars like Gumbs, brown, Ware, and
                Kuppers—poets, memoirists, artists, scholars, and activists—also offer new
                cooperative models. Gumbs, for instance, collaborates with sperm whales—breathing,
                stretching, finding intentionality. Further, her brilliant book <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spill</hi> (2016) is a cross-generation, trans-temporal partnership with

            <p>Marvin, the man I met at the Chicago house party, spent twenty-one years in prison
                while his friend Ronald Kitchen was sentenced to death. I never saw Marvin again,
                and I lost touch with Alice, but I didn’t forget them. The tangle of connections and
                resonances remained emergent for me, demanding my continuing attention.</p>
                
            <p>I learned that while Ronald was in prison, he became one of the “Death Row 10,” Black
                men tortured and wrongfully accused by Burge and his gang of corrupt cops. Ronald
                went on to write his story in his 2018 book <hi rend="italic">My Midnight Years:
                    Surviving Jon Burge’s Police Torture Ring and Death Row</hi>. In a 2019
                interview, he and one of his coauthors, Thai Jones, spoke about the police brutality
                that called to mind so many descriptions in British antislavery writing. They also
                spoke about the importance of storytelling.</p>
                
            <p>Marvin and Ronald may never have been exonerated if activists on the outside,
                including Ronald’s mother, and, it turns out, Alice and some of the people at her
                house party in June 2013, had not made their innocence a major story in Chicago. The
                activists’ work centered on building narratives around Martin and Ronald and other
                wrongly convicted Black men. “It was storytelling that really did work this amazing
                revolution in people’s consciousness,” said Jones (Kitchen). The stories eventually
                engaged the news media, lawmakers, and people like Jesse Jackson, finally forcing
                Chicago to pass a reparations package, the first of its kind in the country. The
                legislation provides compensation, restitution, and rehabilitation services for
                those tortured by Jon Burge.</p>
                
            <p>Recently, Marvin joined Alice for a presentation of Alice’s co-edited book, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Long Term: Resisting Life Sentences, Working toward
                    Freedom</hi> (2018). The book contains an essay by adrienne maree brown. Ronald
                is now an activist speaking out against police brutality and corruption. Even so,
                police continue to harass him. Whenever he’s back in Chicago visiting relatives, as
                he explained in the 2019 interview, police stop him numerous times, a reminder of
                the ruthless stop-and-frisk policies he grew up with on the South Side.</p>
                
            <p>Now, however, the routine is different. When the police pull him over, Ronald
                signifies. He always says, “Officer, why are you pulling me over?” The officer will
                reply: “Your seatbelt.” But Ronald has tinted windows, and he points this out.
                Finally, the officer says, “Is this your car?” “Yes, it is,” Ronald says in a calm,
                steady voice. “Where did you get this Mercedes Benz?” the officer demands. “Well,
                officer,” Ronald says, “you all bought this for me” (Kitchen).</p>

            <head>Emergent: and the future</head>
                
            <p>What does the future of Romantic pedagogy look like? The essays in this volume offer
                some direction. In the spirit of multiplicity and nonlinearity, Botkin reports, “I
                incorporated interviews, images, and films to complement and challenge the
                conventions of literary historiography.” Gordon includes the speculative mode,
                teaching authors like Mat Johnson, Celu Amberstone, and Octavia Butler, while Fay
                focuses on Afrofuturism with the film <hi rend="italic">Black Panther</hi> (2018)
                and N. K. Jemisin’s “How Long ’til Black Future Month?” Such texts, she says,
                present a way of talking about the future in terms other than intergenerational
                trauma and posthumanism.</p>
                
            <p>I am grateful to Joselyn M. Almeida and Amelia Worsley for editing this powerful
                constellation of essays and for inviting me to respond and giving me room to offer a
                few of my own pedagogical practices. To begin with, I want to advocate for new ways
                of writing scholarship and assigning student work. Part of the power of brown’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Emergent Strategy</hi>, after all, is its form. An assemblage of
                narratives, memories, theories, spells, poetry, lists, assessment sheets, oral
                histories, questions, anecdotes, guiding quotations, icons, images, and
                Afro-futures. Such an approach to Romantic scholarship and classroom work can help
                liberate the field. I wholly support Kathleen Stewart’s argument that generalized
                terms like “neoliberalism, advanced capitalism, and globalization . . . do not in
                themselves begin to describe the situation we find ourselves in. The notion of a
                totalized system, of which everything is always already somehow a part, is not
                helpful (to say the least) in the effort to approach a weighted and reeling present”
                (5). Equally, I’m in line with brown’s recommendation that we need to “give each
                other more time to feel, to be in our humanity” (105).</p>
                
            <p>The center of my pedagogical practice today compels students to experiment with modes
                of expression and to co-create with whatever texts we’re discussing. I present them
                with dozens of forms, written and otherwise: letters, manifestos, photo essays,
                short films, fragments, artist books, mixed media collages, erasure poetry,
                assemblage poetry, catalogs, almanacs, and indexes, to name a few. I ask them to
                experiment on even the most scholarly projects. I also encourage them to feel. I
                value experience over explication of literary works, ordinary affects over
                totalizing systems. In my own writing, I’ve pursued an emergent scholarship, one
                mixed up and messy, nonlinear and adaptive, rooted in feeling and imagining as much
                as thinking. Which is why, these last years, I’ve been compiling a catalog of
                emotions to use as a resource. Not big, singular emotions like fear or shock or
                sudden love, but the complex, contradictory, ambivalent churning inside us as we try
                to find stability in an unstable universe, as we try to put past and present in
                place, as we try to find new forms and expressions for the emergent present.</p>
                
            <p>And then, suddenly, some appear from a corner of the world, and we are moved, as when
                Amanda Gorman stood at the podium during the presidential inauguration on January
                20, 2021, and her words, emerging, held us all—not just America, but the world:

            <div type="abstract">
                <p>From the vantage point of our present twenty-first century moment, it would seem impossible to miss the centrality of issues of slavery and 
                    freedom, of racial oppression and Black resistance, to British economic, political, and cultural life during the five decades from the 1780s 
                    through the 1830s. Yet until (comparatively) quite recently, academic and critical discourses on British Romantic literature left these issues 
                    all but entirely out of account. In retrospect, one can diagnose a conservative and indeed White supremacist impulse behind the construction of 
                    the academic study of literary Romanticism and its dominant canon. The essays in this volume do not simply help fill in this enormous critical 
                    blind spot (building on the past thirty years of remedial work by a growing number of scholars) but offer to fundamentally reorient the way 
                    Romanticists envision, organize, and (most importantly) teach their field. Most strikingly, they collectively challenge longstanding notions 
                    of what makes this period “Romantic” through a strategic and innovative disordering of chronology, leading to creative and revealing 
                    juxtapositions between then and now, with reference as well to various charged historical moments in between. In doing so, they help us 
                    see as well a vast web of interconnections among some of the most pressing issues of our own time and the literary and cultural artifacts 
                    they bring into the classroom, and into the canon.</p>

                <p>Reading through this collection of original essays, I have found myself struck again and again at 
                    the ingenious and telling ways contributors have chosen to deploy, disorder, and invert chronology. 
                    The inversions begin with the trenchant introduction by the editors, Joselyn M. Almeida and Amelia Worsley, 
                    who move strategically backward from the racist assaults on Black lives in the present-day United States, 
                    through a series of twentieth- and twenty-first-century interventions in Romantic scholarship, before leaping
                    back to the British Romantic era itself. I will take a somewhat different tack (or rather, series of tacks) 
                    through the timeline, beginning almost thirty-five years ago before moving to consider the six essays that follow Almeida and Worsley’s lead. </p>
                
            <p>In 1990, then, I put out a call for papers for a special MLA session on “Africa in
                the Romantic Imagination”—so far as I knew, or yet know, the first session of its
                kind. The call mentioned not only representations of sub-Saharan Africa, but also of
                race, of slavery in the Americas, of antislavery writing, of the African diaspora in
                England. I cast the net widely. To small avail. Although I issued the call at the
                earliest possible time, over the months of waiting I received a single unsolicited
                proposal. Working my network of friends and colleagues in the profession, I managed
                to drum up one other and then added a proposal of my own, an early version of the
                article that introduced the topic of obeah to Romantic studies (Richardson,
                “Romantic Voodoo”). The session was accepted by the MLA convention committee. It
                drew a small but, as I choose to remember it, an appreciative audience.</p>
                
            <p>No one could read through the introduction to the present collection, let alone the
                essays that follow, without understanding the Romantic era—let’s call it
                1780–1838—as the chronological period that saw the height of the British slave
                trade, a growing British colonial empire fueled by slavery, a burgeoning Black
                population in Britain itself, mass movements advocating abolition and emancipation
                (the first mass political movements in British history), an outpouring of
                antislavery writings of many kinds, and a series of slave uprisings and rebellions
                in the British “sugar islands.” And so it was. And yet, in 1990, all this had long
                remained virtually invisible to mainstream Romantic scholarship to date: hardly
                unthinkable, but rarely thought of. That same year, I published an essay on William
                Blake’s “The Little Black Boy” in relation to issues of race and colonial slavery
                (Richardson, “Colonialism”). Researching that piece I found, much to my amazement,
                that no one had ever thought to publish such an essay before, and that Blake
                scholars had not bothered to ask what Blake meant by the “southern wild” or what had
                brought this imagined Black boy into contact with his “little English” counterpart.
                How, I wondered, was this astounding lack of interest—not to say intellectual
                responsibility—even possible?</p>
                
            <p>Folding this particular, and particularly glaring, absence into a larger evasion of
                history and politics characteristic of Romanticism as it was long taught and studied
                will not do. As David Perkins demonstrated in detail some time ago, what came to be
                called the “Romantic Movement” had been tightly linked with the energies of the
                French Revolution as early as 1802 (by Francis Jeffrey), a linkage that had become a
                “critical commonplace” by the Victorian era (88–90, 99–103). Between William
                Wordsworth’s “levelling muse,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s notorious
                radical-to-conservative arc, Lord Byron’s consistent (his only consistent) ideal of
                “liberty,” and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s outspoken radicalism, Romantic scholarship
                never forgot the impact of European revolutionary politics for long. But the slave
                trade, colonial slavery, the antislavery movement and its vast literature, the
                contributions of Black writers: this history long remained invisible.</p>
                
            <p>Not because the relevant information and trustworthy pointers to the archival record
                would have been hard to find. One needed only turn to Eva Beatrice Dykes’s <hi
                    rend="italic">The Negro in Romantic Thought</hi> (1942) and Wylie Sypher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Guinea’s Captive Kings</hi> (1942)—yet for half a century
                practically no one did. David V. Erdman’s <hi rend="italic">Blake: Prophet against
                    Empire</hi> (1954), the most prominent book to challenge the field’s aversion to
                issues of race, slavery, and colonialism, did not penetrate very far out of the
                tight circle of Blake scholarship and, even there, remained eclipsed by the
                mythopoeic approaches of Northrop Frye and Harold Bloom until rediscovered during
                the new historicist turn of the 1980s and 1990s. And, even then, Romantic
                scholarship lagged behind its neighboring fields: eighteenth-century scholars like
                Moira Ferguson and Victorianists like Patrick Brantliger were publishing important
                studies on antislavery writing, British exploitation of Africa, and the rise of
                modern racism by the mid-1980s, at a time when Henry Louis Gates Jr. began drawing
                critical attention to (as well as republishing) early Black British writers like
                Olaudah Equiano and Mary Prince (both included in Gates’s 1987 volume, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Classic Slave Narratives</hi>).</p>
                
            <p>How else, then, to account for the history of erasure that I and, as it turned out, a
                few scattered Romanticist colleagues found ourselves confronting in 1990? Diagnosing
                a different set of erasures—of the sensibility and sentimental modes so crucial to
                the emergence of anything meaningfully called “Romanticism” and, in particular, of
                the female poets who helped develop them—Jerome McGann noted how a history of
                “reading romanticism through its most conservative venues” had effectively repressed
                critical attention to the “poetics of sensibility” (2). So effectively, indeed, that
                Romanticists had not only failed to read these poets and poetic modes but had lost
                the ability to meaningfully read them at all. From the perspective of 2024, we can
                add that influential constructions of Romanticism, from the Victorian era through
                nearly the end of the twentieth century, were not only masculinist in tendency but
                racist and white supremacist as well. Whatever the Romantic archive held, whatever
                the various (and often changing) views espoused by the literally thousands of
                writers active during that fraught half century, one retrospective version of the
                field after another, in anthologies, in literary histories, in critical studies, in
                class syllabi, rendered the Black lives of the era invisible, including the millions
                of Black lives sacrificed to kidnapping, the Middle Passage, colonial slavery, and
                early death. None of this mattered.</p>
                
            <p>An essay that came out in 1989 both diagnosed and illustrated the problem. In a
                critical examination of Wordsworth’s apathetic response to the movement against the
                “traffickers in Negro blood” (1805 <hi rend="italic">Prelude</hi> 10.206), Mary
                Jacobus located a “historical repression” of the slave trade endemic to “high
                Romantic discourse” (69, 90). But Jacobus failed sufficiently to note that “high”
                Romanticism was and always had been a retrospective construct, the culling of a few
                hundred “essential” texts from a vast archive, a selection, as we have noted,
                motivated in part both by masculinist and racist agendas. Hence “high” Romanticism
                could by definition never include the era’s significant outpouring of antislavery
                literature, a great deal of it contributed by women writers. This reification of a
                purely contingent canon and construction of the field operated well into the
                twentieth century (when “high” Romanticism had, in retrospect almost bizarrely,
                become confined largely to selected works by six male poets). Perversely enough, the
                same reification even informs the first book-length study of Romanticism and slavery
                to appear since Dykes’s 1942 book, <hi rend="italic">Mind-Forg’d Manacles</hi>
                (1994), in which the author, Joan Baum, pointedly differentiates “propaganda” verse
                from the “essential contribution of the Romantics,” whose “<hi rend="italic"
                    >genius</hi>” was to “<hi rend="italic">avoid palpable or overt</hi>” moral
                engagement (xi, 69, caption to figure 13). Case closed.</p>
                
            <p>So the academic field of British Romanticism, in 1990, badly needed reconstruction: a
                project that would take decades of critical work, the latest phase of which this
                volume embodies. Earlier phases—still far from complete—have involved several
                related strategies. One has concerned a combination of archival research and the
                republishing of works long kept out of circulation, as a necessary corrective to
                both the progressive narrowing of the Romantic canon and the field’s longstanding
                refusal to account for Black voices and Black lives. <hi rend="italic">Slavery,
                    Abolition, and Emancipation: Writings in the British Romantic Period</hi>
                (1999), the capacious eight-volume set assembled by Peter Kitson and Debbie Lee,
                stands as the major accomplishment along these lines to date. I would note here as
                well the collections of early Black British writing and the anthologies of
                antislavery verse listed by Almeida and Worsley in their introductory survey. Most
                of these works needed not simply to be republished (in print or online) but edited
                and introduced—made usable to scholars and students encountering them for the first
                time. This effort, as I can personally attest, has often involved a good deal of
                primary research, as even some of the most basic questions of authorship,
                publication history, and early reception had remained murky for over a century and a
                half. Important Romantic-era authors like Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, Mary
                Birkett, and Edward Rushton, for example, had become little more than names attached
                to titles in rare books collections before Romantics scholars began undertaking this
                work of recovery in earnest in the 1990s, building on research by pioneers in other
                fields like Gates, Ferguson, and David Dabydeen.</p>
                
            <p>A second strategy has involved moving “beyond formalism” in a double sense. As part
                of breaking away from notions of a “high” or “essential” Romanticism virtually
                untethered from its human context, the field needed to recruit new reading
                methodologies not only from the “new” historicism but, in this case, from such
                fields as colonial discourse studies, critical race theory, cultural criticism, and
                postcolonial studies as well. The imaginary (not to mention arbitrary and unstable)
                line between literature and ideology, “poetry” and “propaganda,” needed to be
                repeatedly challenged. And “beyond formalism,” as well, in Geoffrey Hartman’s sense
                that formalism (as in the American New Criticism) had not been “formalistic enough”
                (542). New reading strategies could reveal new tensions, contradictions, and
                interventions in texts that had been robbed of their full ideological force through
                interpretative methods designed to yield up well-wrought, “organic” poetic wholes.
                In the case of my own work, this doubly post-formalist poetics meant, for instance,
                locating the play of distinct voices in Blake’s “The Little Black Boy”—the
                Afrocentric voice of the mother, the jarring voice of internalized oppression, the
                emergent yet highly fragile ideological consciousness of the child speaker
                himself—and noting the possibilities arising from the contradictions among them. Or
                locating the stylistic and ideological fractures in “The Sorrows of Yamba”—a popular
                text for recent republishing efforts—that ultimately revealed the hand of two
                distinct authors (Richardson, “‘Sorrows of Yamba’”). These two strategies for moving
                past formalism can effectively complement one another in the classroom, as several
                essays in this volume attest.</p>
                
            <p>From one perspective, such strategies reflected a willingness to bring the ethical
                and political concerns of the present to bear on the histories and literary
                artifacts of the past. And, indeed, some of us were accused at the time of critical
                “anachronism,” of the “condescension of the present,” as though Romantic-era writers
                like Cugoano had never advanced cogent antiracist arguments, as though literally
                thousands of pamphlets, broadsides, and poems had not been written condemning
                slavery and the slave trade, as though even a conservative like Hannah More had not
                denounced the capture and forced transport of millions of Africans on the grounds of
                “human rights” (<hi rend="italic">Slavery, a Poem</hi>, line 260). Yet, from a
                different perspective, such work might be seen as a corrective to and thickening of
                the traditional Romantic chronology. Adding in historical dates like 1772
                (Mansfield’s <hi rend="italic">Somerset</hi> decision), 1781 (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zong</hi> massacre), 1788 (the first great outpouring of antislavery agitation,
                petitions, and writings), 1791 (the Haitian Revolution), 1795–96 (the second Maroon
                War in Jamaica), 1807 (the abolition of the slave trade), 1823 (the Demerara slave
                revolt), and 1831 (the “Christmas” rebellion in Jamaica). Adding in literary dates
                like 1773 (Phillis Wheatley Peters’s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>), 1782 (Ignatius
                Sancho’s <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>), 1786 (Thomas Clarkson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species</hi>), 1787 (Cugoano’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Thoughts and Sentiments</hi>), 1789 (Equiano’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi>), 1817 (Robert Wedderburn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Axe Laid to the Root</hi>), and 1831 (Prince’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi>). Asserting, as the end date to the “Romantic period” construct
                itself, the claims of the Emancipation year 1838, marking the abandonment of the
                “Apprenticeship” program and the effective end of slavery in the British West Indian
                colonies.</p>
                
            <p>Yet thirty years of such remedial work—filling in gaps, adding texts and authors,
                reading more historically and more critically—have only done so much. As Almeida and
                Worsley note in their introduction, while we now have a “somewhat” expanded canon,
                antislavery writing still occupies at best a “marginal position” in Romantic
                pedagogy, with just a few (increasingly predictable) additions to course syllabi and
                too little attention to innovative classroom interventions. And so, to return to my
                initial impression of this volume’s own series of interventions, the Romantic
                chronology needs not just filling in but creative disruption, rearrangement,
                inversion, juxtaposition. Strict chronology—despite attempts to render it more
                faithful—has gone out of date.</p>
                
            <p>Again, we see the first gesture toward rethinking chronology in the editors’
                decision, in their introduction, to work backward and “explore how the present
                moment informs the ways that students might currently receive Romantic texts.” This
                should not be viewed as an attempt to make our courses more “relatable” (and perhaps
                increase our market share of bodies in the classroom), although that might prove a
                kind of side-effect of our revisionary efforts. Rather, we would be doing our
                students an acute disservice, and allowing ourselves to appear aridly out of touch,
                were we to pretend that issues of racism, racial violence and oppression, Black
                agency, and the value of Black lives were somehow <hi rend="italic">not</hi> living
                and pressing matters. We would also be robbing our students of a chance to study the
                genealogy of our critical situation today in events, practices, and ideologies that
                were salient in the period we study and teach—however long they remained repressed
                from our field’s scholarly consciousness. If this is “presentism,” it is a frank
                acknowledgment of our present concerns and perspectives that better reveals, rather
                than distorts, the long-occluded record of the Romantic past.</p>
                
            <p>Patricia A. Matthew, in her essay on “Romanticism and the Abolitionist Turn,” aptly
                characterizes the classroom sense of the Romantic era passed on to my own generation
                of scholars: “a period where there are no Black people or people of color, no
                questions about identity, race, and citizenship, and where the only revolutionary
                activities took place in France.” And she argues forcefully that no merely
                chronological approach to the past as somehow disconnected from these questions as
                posed in our own moment will suffice to reorient our, and our students’, attention.
                As Matthew stresses, primary texts do not “teach us about the past” but rather “show
                us select representations of the past”; historians as well can never offer a “fixed
                report of the past” but only a reconstruction inevitably informed by living concerns
                and debates. By insisting throughout her essay on past documents and timelines as
                    <hi rend="italic">representations</hi>, Matthew offers another way to contest
                positivist notions of history and implicitly white supremacist accounts of the
                field.</p>
                
            <p>Nicolas Blaisdell provides first-person evidence of how encountering antislavery
                writing in a college classroom setting can stimulate and inform social justice
                activism in the present, which then in turn feeds into more robust antiracist
                pedagogical strategies. In keeping with this volume’s frequent recourse to
                chronological inversion, Blaisdell begins with an incident from July 2020, an
                encounter between a group of Black Lives Matter activists and officers from the
                Peabody, Massachusetts police department: a beginning that immediately suggests
                continuities between then and now, and a porousness between “academic” pursuits and
                action in the world. Intriguingly, Blaisdell traces his political activism back to
                his classroom exposure to two early Black British writers, Cugoano and Prince, along
                with the critique of early Victorian laissez-faire capitalism developed by Friedrich
                Engels. Key to Blaisdell’s own critique is his view of slavery not simply as a past
                artifact to study but as a tradition of racialized oppression persisting in such
                twenty-first-century forms as “unfree prison labor, unfree migrant labor, and unfree
                international labor.” Just as significantly, Blaisdell traces the emergence of his
                own antiracist activism to the inspiration of texts and events from the Romantic
                past, when abolitionist groups organized “unprecedented petitions, protests, legal
                proceedings, and other forms of civic action.” His story bears powerful witness to
                the dynamic potential residing in the encounter of the artifactual past, the current
                pursuit of racial and economic justice, and the college classroom.</p>
                
            <p>In his meditation on “Teaching Antislavery,” Sean Gordon draws on theories of
                Afropessimism to drive home a comparable insistence on the continuities between the
                Romantic era and the moment we find ourselves in today. “I wanted students to engage
                with this continuum,” he writes, “to question their assumptions about the ‘pastness’
                of slavery, the progressiveness of liberal democracy, and the putative postracialism
                of the Obama administration.” To this end, Gordon stretches inherited notions of
                Romanticism both geographically and chronologically. Geographically—by including a
                late Romantic American author like Edgar Allan Poe and by implicitly acknowledging
                the pointlessness of trying to circumscribe so cosmopolitan a writer as Equiano
                within a British, American, or transatlantic tradition: his career in fact exposes
                the arbitrariness of such categories. Chronologically—in bringing out the dialogue
                between Romantic texts and various later texts that demonstrate, in their own ways,
                the presentness of the past, including Mat Johnson’s twenty-first-century response
                to Poe in <hi rend="italic">Pym</hi>, as well as fiction by Octavia Butler, Samuel
                Delany, and Celu Amberstone. Because the Black protagonist of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pym</hi> begins the novel as an English professor, Gordon’s syllabus also helps
                break down any imagined sense of “college” as a cloistered space somehow insulated
                from the racist ideologies and the incidents of racially motivated violence swirling
                all around it—and, as Gordon’s opening demonstrates, within it. As we attempt to
                track the major dates we transit through in Gordon’s essay—2014, 2015, 2011, 1838,
                2004, 1995, 1966, 1789—chronology becomes not a series of beads on a string
                distantly linking then and now but a flexible story line, with flashbacks and
                fast-forwards, foreshadowings and back projections. Freed from the remorselessness
                of chronological succession, Gordon’s students can make their own dynamic
                connections among current, past, and personally experienced events and the literary
                texts that variously represent or refract them.</p>
                
            <p>Chronological inversions can involve a matter of years or a matter of centuries, as
                Elizabeth Fay’s essay makes clear. Teaching Prince’s <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
                (1831) in advance of Equiano’s <hi rend="italic">Interesting Narrative</hi> (1789),
                while “achronological,” encourages students to encounter Equiano’s more distanced,
                “rhetorically sophisticated” narrative only after registering the powerfully
                visceral impact of Prince’s account. (Fay also exposes her students to first-person
                historical accounts to increase their chances of sensing the “gut-level pain” of
                colonial slavery.) Fay’s pedagogy, like Gordon’s, also extends chronology beyond the
                present, including “Afrofuturist” works like Ryan Coogler’s <hi rend="italic">Black
                    Panther</hi> film (2018). And, as Ivan Ortiz demonstrates in an especially
                resonant essay, chronology can be pushed backward as well. Asking what it might mean
                to sing an antislavery ballad to the tune of “Admiral Hosier’s Ghost,” Ortiz invites
                his students, and us, to hear the “haunting” of abolitionist verse by prior,
                colonialist voices, a “white noise” that may function to obliterate the otherness of
                the enslaved subject. His hauntological analysis helps us understand the limits of
                sympathy—now as then—which may forestall rather than facilitate an “authentic
                encounter with human otherness.”</p>
                
            <p>Expanding on what Fay calls her achronological strategy, Frances Botkin, borrowing
                from Jamaican Creole, develops a critical and pedagogical approach she terms <hi
                    rend="italic">tunyuhan</hi>. Following the Jamaican Maroon practice of making do
                    (<hi rend="italic">mek fashion</hi>) with what comes to hand (<hi rend="italic"
                    >tun yu han</hi>, turn your hand), Botkin draws on an eclectic array of
                materials—“borrowing from other fields, experimenting with different genres, and
                branching into other centuries”—to fill in the silences and reveal the distortions
                endemic even to Black British writing, highly mediated as it was, in the Romantic
                era. Her resources include living Maroon oral traditions—and living Maroon speakers
                and activists. Botkin exposes her students to “knowledge beyond the archive” in an
                effort to incorporate living voices and ultimately “remake Romanticism.”</p>
                
            <p>It might be said that every generation of Romantic scholars and teachers remakes the
                field, but not often, and perhaps not ever, so radically as over the past
                thirty-five to forty-five years of canon revision and critical reorientation. Women
                writers are now, for the first time, well represented in anthologies and teaching
                syllabi. Black writers and antislavery writing remain marginal to the field as a
                whole, yet the reparative work begun in the 1990s continues and the present volume
                does much to advance it. And recent events have shown just how urgent and how vital
                such work has grown.</p>
                
            <p>I first read these essays at around the time of the now infamous attack on the U.S.
                Congress as it met to ratify the electoral college results of the 2020 presidential
                election on January 6, 2021. A large mob of right-wing rioters broke into the
                Capitol Building, seeking to disrupt the count, perhaps to murder any number of
                Democratic legislators, and bearing with them Confederate flags, Crusader crosses,
                nooses, and other white nationalist emblems, while sporting an odd combination of
                tactical apparel and Trump campaign gear. It was an attempted coup motivated by
                racist and white supremacist ideologies and egged on by the outgoing (at last)
                President himself. In the aftermath of this brazen attack on American democracy, no
                one any longer has an excuse for branding efforts such as those offered in this
                volume as “presentism” or as performative “wokeness” or as some passing academic
                leftist fad. All of us are now called to examine the racism and white supremacism
                operative, subtly or not, in our professions and workplaces, our political and
                religious organizations, our most seemingly casual encounters; in our own words and
                writings and acts and, not least, in our classrooms. I take heart, in a desperate
                time, from the voices resonating throughout this collection—the essayists’ voices to
                be sure, but also the voices reclaimed from the archive, and the living voices of
                students and activists and “oracles” quoted so liberally throughout. We will need at
                least another thirty years of remaking Romanticism as a more historically accurate,
                truly representative, and ethically responsible field. This volume points the
                way.</p>
