                <p>In 2001, the <emph>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</emph> published a volume
                    devoted to politics in Shelley titled <emph>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist
                        Poetry, 1819-1820</emph>. The volume comprises essays by Samuel Gladden,
                    Robert Kaufman, and Mark Kipperman, which, taken together and along with the
                    introduction by volume editor Michael Scrivener and the embedded responses by
                    Steven Jones, carefully articulate—and necessarily complicate—what Marc Redfield
                    has called “one of Romanticism’s greatest legacies: how to think of the
                    political force of literary texts” (150). Gladden’s analysis of political and
                    revolutionary bodies in <emph>Oedipus Tyrannus; or, Swellfoot the Tyrant</emph>;
                    Kaufman’s delineation of a “literary trajectory” linking Shelley to the
                    theorists involved in and the artists connected to Frankfurt School critical
                    aesthetics; and Kipperman’s re-grounding of “The Mask of Anarchy” in the
                    iconology of its moment—each foreground implicitly Redfield’s generative
                    question by homing in on Shelley’s political poetry in the wake of the Peterloo
                    Massacre in August 1819. And rightly so. As James Chandler has put it,
                    “‘Peterloo’—like ‘The French Revolution’ on a higher scale or even
                    ‘Romanticism,’ itself on a scale yet higher still—names an event of
                    indeterminate duration that marks a transformation in the practices of modern
                    literary and political representation, one understood in its moment to have
                    revolutionary potential” (18). A crisis in the theory and practice of
                    representation both political <emph>and</emph> literary, that is, along with a
                    palpable sense of the emancipatory possibilities latent in this confluence of
                    the political and the literary, then, demarcate the situation of 1819-20 into
                    which Shelley sought to intervene with his poetry and prose.</p>
                <p>Yet what does it mean—what could it mean—for a work of art to intervene in its
                    immediate political context? What do we mean when we label a set of poems
                    “interventionist”? Does the adjectival usage foreclose the judgment as to
                    whether or not a work has, in actuality, intervened—or, perhaps more aptly, on
                    whether or not it is even able to intervene, thus relegating the label
                    “interventionist” to the level of stated intention? Shelley is perhaps more
                    slippery on the subject of just how he imagined his writing to affect politics
                    than we have given him credit for. As he articulated in a number of places in
                    1819 and 1820, Shelley certainly intended his work to intervene in at least a
                    basic sense of the term. It is well known that many of his post-Peterloo
                    efforts, including “The Mask of Anarchy,” were part of what he described—that
                    is, what he pitched—to Leigh Hunt as “a little volume of popular songs
                        <emph>wholly political</emph>, destined to awaken and direct the imagination
                    of the reformers” (<emph>Letters</emph> 2, 191). Here Shelley foresees his poems
                    affecting the “imagination”—not the actions or the strategies—of a specific
                    group of individuals, the political and intellectual leaders of the reform
                    movement. What is more, “wholly political” seems to imply that his other poems
                    from this period, those not intended for the “little volume of popular songs,”
                    must be at least partially “political.” Indeed, in the preface to the lyrical
                    drama <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>, published in 1820, Shelley acknowledges
                    his personal commitment to reform but specifies that “it is a mistake to suppose
                    that I dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of
                    reform,” before going on famously to say “didactic poetry is my abhorrence”
                    (Shelley 209). “Solely” here suggests, I think, that reform nonetheless remains
                    a commitment of Shelley’s poetry, even when its antididactic aim is to offer
                    “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209).</p>
                <p>These two representative attempts by Shelley, originating in the crucible of
                    post-Peterloo British letters, to articulate the relationship between poetry and
                    politics implicate his work in a longer conversation to which Adorno contributed
                    the terms “commitment” and “autonomy” in “Commitment,” his response to Sartre’s
                        <emph>What is Literature?</emph> Committed or interventionist art would be
                    “wholly political,” aimed at the “reformers” (<emph>Letters</emph> 2, 191) and
                    at the “direct enforcement of reform (209)”; autonomous art might be described
                    as “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209). As Scrivener writes in the
                    Introduction to <emph>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist Poetry,
                    1819-1820</emph>, “the very word and category, ‘interventionist,’ is still vexed
                    by the . . . binary opposition of escapist and interventionist, idealist and
                    materialist, [and] resurrects a debate in which Adorno seems to have had the
                    last word, but one has to emphasize ‘seems.’” Indeed, the deep insights of the
                    previous <emph>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</emph> volume on Shelley’s
                    politics reside in the ability of the contributions, along with the responses by
                    Steven Jones, to think through and then beyond what Scrivener calls the
                    “antimony of commitment and autonomy”—to activate, that is, the Shelley whose
                    poetry can be “both autonomous and interventionist.” </p>
                <p>The present volume sustains the necessity of seeing through and beyond this
                    antinomy by continuing the work of rereading and reimagining the political in
                    Shelley’s writings and his legacy. Indeed, as Mischa Willett demonstrates, the
                    Victorian appropriation of Shelley’s ouevre into a binary of Matthew Arnold’s
                    “ineffectual angel” on the one hand and, on the other, G. B. Shaw’s Shelley who
                    penned the “Chartist Bible” leaves out a crucial feature of Shelley’s Victorian
                    reception: the Spasmodics, whose indebtedness to Shelley comprises both a
                    radical aestheticism and a critical politics, whereby the former provides the
                    foundation of the latter. Often read apolitically and under the sign of Keats,
                    the Spasmodic School is more accurately identified as Shelleyan, Willett argues.
                    If, as Willett suggests, Sydney Dobell’s Spasmodic and Shelleyan <emph>The
                        Roman</emph> (1850) inspired Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian liberation
                    leader, can we term this effect an intervention into politics by the spirit of
                    Shelley? A similar question should be asked of the influence of Shelley’s ideas,
                    mediated indeed by their Victorian reception, on the nonviolence of Mohandas K.
                    Gandhi—a lineage that informs Borushko’s argument in the present volume for a
                    close relationship, smithied in Shelley’s post-Peterloo poetics and then shaped
                    in twentieth-century forms of political and aesthetic resistance, between art
                    and nonviolence.</p>
                <p>Michael Demson’s essay returns us to Britain in the aftermath of Peterloo, where
                    the stakes of an author’s commitments and attempts at intervention come sharply
                    into focus. Demson tells the story of “John Cahuac, a radical London publisher,
                    who was effectively silenced and removed from any political discourse, and the
                    fate of his satirical writings, almost entirely forgotten today.” As Demson
                    contextualizes with rich comparative detail, both Cahuac and Shelley, coming
                    from dramatically different class positions, turned to seditious satire in the
                    months after Peterloo. Cahuac’s forgotten works, which he wrote as well as
                    published himself, include a defiant open letter to Lord Sidmouth and a pamphlet
                    titled “Who killed Cock Robin?: a satirical tragedy, or hieroglyphic prophecy on
                    the Manchester Blot!!!” These and other of Cahuac’s writings aimed ultimately,
                    as Shelley’s attempts at satire also aimed, Demson argues, to awaken the popular
                    imagination to the need for political solidarity. But Cahuac was tried at least
                    twice for seditious libel in his career, and in 1823 he was convicted of
                    stealing an octavo edition of Lingard’s <emph>History of England</emph> (which
                    he claimed he owned legally), for which he was sentenced to fourteen years
                    transportation and sent to Van Dieman’s Land. He never returned. “Why crush a
                    starving bookseller?,” Demson quotes Shelley writing to Leigh Hunt, for thereby
                    “tyrants . . . strike in his person at all of their political enemies” and
                    “divert the attention of the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive
                    Government.” One could say that tyranny crushed Cahuac, and, as Demson argues
                    and implies on a broader scale, one could also say that such actions forced
                    Romantics and post-Romantics, including Shelley and those who take up his
                    mantle, to imagine new forms of interventionist art. </p>
                <p>The essays by Borushko, Lambier, and McGeough turn to the sensorium as the locus
                    of new political possibilities in Shelley’s work. Borushko’s argument for the
                    immanent nonviolence of art—differently inflected in Shelley, Adorno, and
                    Jacques Rancière—relies upon, in the end, the resistance of aesthetic form to
                    the existing order of the sensible. Through such resistance, a work of art at
                    the same time reorders the realm of the sensible by virtue of its very
                    existence. Indeed, this resistance and consequent redistribution, dramatized so
                    aptly in “The Mask of Anarchy,” names what Rancière identifies as the truly
                    critical politics of art. Rancière, whose writing on art and politics motivates
                    not only Borushko’s but also Lambier’s and McGeough’s essays, challenges us
                    finally to see past older, antinomian versions of the politics of a poem. In
                    other words, Rancière enjoins us to move beyond “the relationship of the poet
                        <emph>to</emph> politics” and “the presence of politics <emph>in</emph> the
                    poem” in order to conceive “the very politics <emph>of</emph> the poetry, the
                    manner in which poetry configures the space in which its productions are
                    inscribed” (240). Lambier’s strategy to push this conversation forward locates
                    Shelley’s thought in the debates surrounding rights in the Romantic age.
                    Centrally, Lambier demonstrates that criticisms such as Hazlitt’s of Shelley—“I
                    think he is chargeable with extreme levity,” Hazlitt writes—intersect with the
                    language of critics in the legal-rights camp of natural rights theorists, such
                    as Shelley, according to Lambier, whose work is a part of what Lynn Hunt has
                    characterized as the invention of human rights. Shelley’s poetry and prose thus
                    participates in the extension of rights to those groups who are excluded by the
                    narrower circle drawn by constitutionalist interpretations of rights
                    declarations.</p>
                <p>McGeough’s contribution to the volume is another example of this. His ability to
                    find in Shelley an “aesthetics of anarchism”—ultimately a reading of political
                    form before, or as determinative of, political content—offers a new angle on a
                    perennial issue in the critical conversation on Shelley’s politics: his
                    relationship to the anarchist tradition. In a review essay from 1985, William
                    Keach, reflecting on important advances in scholarship on Shelley’s politics by
                    Michael Scrivener and P. M. S. Dawson, notes that both works reveal “the
                    limitations of characterizing Shelley as an anarchist,” not only because of the
                    distance between our definition of the term and Shelley’s use of it, but also
                    because of the influence on Shelley of Thomas Paine’s—more so than William
                    Godwin’s—views of government (126). Complicating this binary of Paine or Godwin
                    but encompassing both possibilities, McGeough establishes the “dissensus,” a
                    term from Rancière that both McGeough and Lambier place in conversation with
                    Shelley, which appears in “The Mask of Anarchy” with the emergence of the “Shape
                    arrayed in mail” that resists the ordering, the violent consensus, of the
                    sensible established by Anarchy’s procession. In Lambier’s essay, it is
                        <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> wherein Shelley stages dissensus: “the
                    epipsyche of aesthetic experience places two senses of the world side by side,
                    the prevailing order and a virtual alternative, thus opening up new
                    possibilities for reconfiguration.” </p>
                <p>On this point, the retrojection of Rancière’s notions of “dissensus” and the
                    redistribution of the sensible onto Shelley’s works from 1819-1820, Lambier’s
                    essay unites with Borushko’s and McGeough’s in their attempts to think beyond
                    the old impasse between Shelley’s commitments and his moments of artistic
                    autonomy. Indeed, the essays by Demson and Willett join the others in charting
                    new political possibilities in our estimation of Shelley’s body of work—pathways
                    that take us back to post-Peterloo repression through to the Victorian
                    Shelleyans, and then forward to Rancière’s post-Marxism.</p>
