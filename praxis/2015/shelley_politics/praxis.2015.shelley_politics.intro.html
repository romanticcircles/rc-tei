               <h1><span class="head">Introduction</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In 2001, the <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> published a volume devoted to politics in Shelley titled <em>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist Poetry, 1819-1820</em>. The volume comprises essays by Samuel Gladden, Robert Kaufman, and Mark Kipperman,
               which, taken together and along with the introduction by volume editor Michael Scrivener
               and the embedded responses by Steven Jones, carefully articulate—and necessarily complicate—what
               Marc Redfield has called “one of Romanticism’s greatest legacies: how to think of
               the political force of literary texts” (150). Gladden’s analysis of political and
               revolutionary bodies in <em>Oedipus Tyrannus; or, Swellfoot the Tyrant</em>; Kaufman’s delineation of a “literary trajectory” linking Shelley to the theorists
               involved in and the artists connected to Frankfurt School critical aesthetics; and
               Kipperman’s re-grounding of “The Mask of Anarchy” in the iconology of its moment—each
               foreground implicitly Redfield’s generative question by homing in on Shelley’s political
               poetry in the wake of the Peterloo Massacre in August 1819. And rightly so. As James
               Chandler has put it, “‘Peterloo’—like ‘The French Revolution’ on a higher scale or
               even ‘Romanticism,’ itself on a scale yet higher still—names an event of indeterminate
               duration that marks a transformation in the practices of modern literary and political
               representation, one understood in its moment to have revolutionary potential” (18).
               A crisis in the theory and practice of representation both political <em>and</em> literary, that is, along with a palpable sense of the emancipatory possibilities
               latent in this confluence of the political and the literary, then, demarcate the situation
               of 1819-20 into which Shelley sought to intervene with his poetry and prose.</p>
            <p>Yet what does it mean—what could it mean—for a work of art to intervene in its immediate
               political context? What do we mean when we label a set of poems “interventionist”?
               Does the adjectival usage foreclose the judgment as to whether or not a work has,
               in actuality, intervened—or, perhaps more aptly, on whether or not it is even able
               to intervene, thus relegating the label “interventionist” to the level of stated intention?
               Shelley is perhaps more slippery on the subject of just how he imagined his writing
               to affect politics than we have given him credit for. As he articulated in a number
               of places in 1819 and 1820, Shelley certainly intended his work to intervene in at
               least a basic sense of the term. It is well known that many of his post-Peterloo efforts,
               including “The Mask of Anarchy,” were part of what he described—that is, what he pitched—to
               Leigh Hunt as “a little volume of popular songs <em>wholly political</em>, destined to awaken and direct the imagination of the reformers” (<em>Letters</em> 2, 191). Here Shelley foresees his poems affecting the “imagination”—not the actions
               or the strategies—of a specific group of individuals, the political and intellectual
               leaders of the reform movement. What is more, “wholly political” seems to imply that
               his other poems from this period, those not intended for the “little volume of popular
               songs,” must be at least partially “political.” Indeed, in the preface to the lyrical
               drama <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, published in 1820, Shelley acknowledges his personal commitment to reform but specifies
               that “it is a mistake to suppose that I dedicate my poetical compositions solely to
               the direct enforcement of reform,” before going on famously to say “didactic poetry
               is my abhorrence” (Shelley 209). “Solely” here suggests, I think, that reform nonetheless
               remains a commitment of Shelley’s poetry, even when its antididactic aim is to offer
               “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209).</p>
            <p>These two representative attempts by Shelley, originating in the crucible of post-Peterloo
               British letters, to articulate the relationship between poetry and politics implicate
               his work in a longer conversation to which Adorno contributed the terms “commitment”
               and “autonomy” in “Commitment,” his response to Sartre’s <em>What is Literature?</em> Committed or interventionist art would be “wholly political,” aimed at the “reformers”
               (<em>Letters</em> 2, 191) and at the “direct enforcement of reform (209)”; autonomous art might be
               described as “beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209). As Scrivener writes
               in the Introduction to <em>Reading Shelley’s Interventionist Poetry, 1819-1820</em>, “the very word and category, ‘interventionist,’ is still vexed by the . . . binary
               opposition of escapist and interventionist, idealist and materialist, [and] resurrects
               a debate in which Adorno seems to have had the last word, but one has to emphasize
               ‘seems.’” Indeed, the deep insights of the previous <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> volume on Shelley’s politics reside in the ability of the contributions, along with
               the responses by Steven Jones, to think through and then beyond what Scrivener calls
               the “antimony of commitment and autonomy”—to activate, that is, the Shelley whose
               poetry can be “both autonomous and interventionist.”</p>
            <p>The present volume sustains the necessity of seeing through and beyond this antinomy
               by continuing the work of rereading and reimagining the political in Shelley’s writings
               and his legacy. Indeed, as Mischa Willett demonstrates, the Victorian appropriation
               of Shelley’s ouevre into a binary of Matthew Arnold’s “ineffectual angel” on the one
               hand and, on the other, G. B. Shaw’s Shelley who penned the “Chartist Bible” leaves
               out a crucial feature of Shelley’s Victorian reception: the Spasmodics, whose indebtedness
               to Shelley comprises both a radical aestheticism and a critical politics, whereby
               the former provides the foundation of the latter. Often read apolitically and under
               the sign of Keats, the Spasmodic School is more accurately identified as Shelleyan,
               Willett argues. If, as Willett suggests, Sydney Dobell’s Spasmodic and Shelleyan <em>The Roman</em> (1850) inspired Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian liberation leader, can we term this
               effect an intervention into politics by the spirit of Shelley? A similar question
               should be asked of the influence of Shelley’s ideas, mediated indeed by their Victorian
               reception, on the nonviolence of Mohandas K. Gandhi—a lineage that informs Borushko’s
               argument in the present volume for a close relationship, smithied in Shelley’s post-Peterloo
               poetics and then shaped in twentieth-century forms of political and aesthetic resistance,
               between art and nonviolence.</p>
            <p>Michael Demson’s essay returns us to Britain in the aftermath of Peterloo, where the
               stakes of an author’s commitments and attempts at intervention come sharply into focus.
               Demson tells the story of “John Cahuac, a radical London publisher, who was effectively
               silenced and removed from any political discourse, and the fate of his satirical writings,
               almost entirely forgotten today.” As Demson contextualizes with rich comparative detail,
               both Cahuac and Shelley, coming from dramatically different class positions, turned
               to seditious satire in the months after Peterloo. Cahuac’s forgotten works, which
               he wrote as well as published himself, include a defiant open letter to Lord Sidmouth
               and a pamphlet titled “Who killed Cock Robin?: a satirical tragedy, or hieroglyphic
               prophecy on the Manchester Blot!!!” These and other of Cahuac’s writings aimed ultimately,
               as Shelley’s attempts at satire also aimed, Demson argues, to awaken the popular imagination
               to the need for political solidarity. But Cahuac was tried at least twice for seditious
               libel in his career, and in 1823 he was convicted of stealing an octavo edition of
               Lingard’s <em>History of England</em> (which he claimed he owned legally), for which he was sentenced to fourteen years
               transportation and sent to Van Dieman’s Land. He never returned. “Why crush a starving
               bookseller?,” Demson quotes Shelley writing to Leigh Hunt, for thereby “tyrants .
               . . strike in his person at all of their political enemies” and “divert the attention
               of the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive Government.” One could say
               that tyranny crushed Cahuac, and, as Demson argues and implies on a broader scale,
               one could also say that such actions forced Romantics and post-Romantics, including
               Shelley and those who take up his mantle, to imagine new forms of interventionist
               art.</p>
            <p>The essays by Borushko, Lambier, and McGeough turn to the sensorium as the locus of
               new political possibilities in Shelley’s work. Borushko’s argument for the immanent
               nonviolence of art—differently inflected in Shelley, Adorno, and Jacques Rancière—relies
               upon, in the end, the resistance of aesthetic form to the existing order of the sensible.
               Through such resistance, a work of art at the same time reorders the realm of the
               sensible by virtue of its very existence. Indeed, this resistance and consequent redistribution,
               dramatized so aptly in “The Mask of Anarchy,” names what Rancière identifies as the
               truly critical politics of art. Rancière, whose writing on art and politics motivates
               not only Borushko’s but also Lambier’s and McGeough’s essays, challenges us finally
               to see past older, antinomian versions of the politics of a poem. In other words,
               Rancière enjoins us to move beyond “the relationship of the poet <em>to</em> politics” and “the presence of politics <em>in</em> the poem” in order to conceive “the very politics <em>of</em> the poetry, the manner in which poetry configures the space in which its productions
               are inscribed” (240). Lambier’s strategy to push this conversation forward locates
               Shelley’s thought in the debates surrounding rights in the Romantic age. Centrally,
               Lambier demonstrates that criticisms such as Hazlitt’s of Shelley—“I think he is chargeable
               with extreme levity,” Hazlitt writes—intersect with the language of critics in the
               legal-rights camp of natural rights theorists, such as Shelley, according to Lambier,
               whose work is a part of what Lynn Hunt has characterized as the invention of human
               rights. Shelley’s poetry and prose thus participates in the extension of rights to
               those groups who are excluded by the narrower circle drawn by constitutionalist interpretations
               of rights declarations.</p>
            <p>McGeough’s contribution to the volume is another example of this. His ability to find
               in Shelley an “aesthetics of anarchism”—ultimately a reading of political form before,
               or as determinative of, political content—offers a new angle on a perennial issue
               in the critical conversation on Shelley’s politics: his relationship to the anarchist
               tradition. In a review essay from 1985, William Keach, reflecting on important advances
               in scholarship on Shelley’s politics by Michael Scrivener and P. M. S. Dawson, notes
               that both works reveal “the limitations of characterizing Shelley as an anarchist,”
               not only because of the distance between our definition of the term and Shelley’s
               use of it, but also because of the influence on Shelley of Thomas Paine’s—more so
               than William Godwin’s—views of government (126). Complicating this binary of Paine
               or Godwin but encompassing both possibilities, McGeough establishes the “dissensus,”
               a term from Rancière that both McGeough and Lambier place in conversation with Shelley,
               which appears in “The Mask of Anarchy” with the emergence of the “Shape arrayed in
               mail” that resists the ordering, the violent consensus, of the sensible established
               by Anarchy’s procession. In Lambier’s essay, it is <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> wherein Shelley stages dissensus: “the epipsyche of aesthetic experience places two
               senses of the world side by side, the prevailing order and a virtual alternative,
               thus opening up new possibilities for reconfiguration.”</p>
            <p>On this point, the retrojection of Rancière’s notions of “dissensus” and the redistribution
               of the sensible onto Shelley’s works from 1819-1820, Lambier’s essay unites with Borushko’s
               and McGeough’s in their attempts to think beyond the old impasse between Shelley’s
               commitments and his moments of artistic autonomy. Indeed, the essays by Demson and
               Willett join the others in charting new political possibilities in our estimation
               of Shelley’s body of work—pathways that take us back to post-Peterloo repression through
               to the Victorian Shelleyans, and then forward to Rancière’s post-Marxism.</p>
