                <head>Introduction: Percy Shelley and the Delimitation of the Gothic</head>
                <byline><docAuthor>David Brookshire</docAuthor><affiliation>University of Maryland,

                <p>Given the growing interest in the relationship between “Romantic” and “Gothic”
                    writing, surprisingly little attention has been given to Percy Bysshe Shelley,
                    for whom, more than any other major Romantic, the Gothic arguably provided the
                    most powerful and lasting influence. Although Shelley claimed, in a letter to
                    William Godwin, that by 1812 he was no longer a “votary of Romance,” the Gothic
                    aesthetic saturates his early poetry and casts a gloomy shadow over even the
                    most idealistic moments in his mature work. As a budding Gothic novelist himself
                    during his teenage years, Shelley appears to have grown impatient with the
                    narrative constraints of prose fiction, choosing instead to invest his creative
                    energies in poetry while still exploring the aesthetic possibilities and
                    contradictions associated with the Gothic aesthetic. His reading habits and
                    poetic interests suggest that what he had given up was not an interest in the
                    Gothic itself but in the stock conventions of the “Old Gothic” of Walpole and
                    Radcliffe that had since become the object of satire in the early-nineteenth
                    century. According to Mary Shelley’s Journal, both Mary and Percy continued to
                    read a number of Gothic texts, which included William Beckford’s <title
                        level="m">Vathek</title>; Charles Brockden Brown’s <title level="m"
                        >Weiland</title>, <title level="m">Ormond</title>, <title level="m">Edgar
                        Huntley</title>, and <title level="m">Arthur Merwyn</title>; Charlotte
                    Dacre’s <title level="m">Zafloya</title>; Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                        Williams </title>and <title level="m">St. Leon</title>; Caroline Lamb’s
                        <title level="m">Glenarvon</title>; Charles Maturin’s <title level="m">Fatal
                        Revenge; or the Family of Montorio</title> and <title level="m">J</title>.
                        <title level="m">Bertram</title>; Thomas Love Peacock’s <title level="m"
                        >Nightmare Abbey </title>(in which Shelley is playfully satirized in the
                    character of Scythrop); John Polidori’s <title level="m">The Vampyre</title>;
                    along with all of Matthew Lewis’s and Ann Radcliffe’s works. Shelley also
                    enjoyed the Gothic productions of Germany, which included Goethe’s <title
                        level="m">Faust</title>; Frederick Schiller’s <title level="m">The Robbers
                    </title>and <title level="m">The Ghost Seer</title>; and the aptly titled <title
                        level="m">Phantasmagoriana</title>, a French translation of supernatural
                    stories that was translated into English in 1812 as <title level="m">Tales of
                        the Dead</title>. </p>
                <p> The contributors to this volume aim to explore the ways in which Shelley
                    “delimits” the Gothic, opening the symbolic potentiality of an aesthetic that is
                    always caught between its reactionary and revolutionary, reifying and
                    transformative impulses. Shelley’s early poetry and prose, including his two
                    published Gothic novels—<title level="m">Zastrozzi, a Romance </title>(1810)
                    and <title level="m">St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian</title> (1811)—and his
                    first book-length poem, <title level="m">The Wandering Jew; or The Victim of the
                        Eternal Avenger</title> (1809/10), have received scant critical attention,
                    often relegated to appendices or a “Juvenilia” section in editions of Shelley’s
                    works. The essays in this volume, however, call for an analysis that approaches
                    these works with the same theoretical rigor that his mature poetry receives and,
                    thus, to fill a gap in Shelley scholarship by establishing new readings and
                    identifying avenues for future research. We all argue, in different ways, that
                    recognizing Shelley’s Gothic sensibility is fundamental to fully appreciate his
                    struggle to mediate the Gothic antagonisms that persist in his poetry throughout
                    his career. Each essay in the volume interrogates the distinction between what
                    can be called the <title level="m">Shelleyan</title> subject of Romanticism and
                    the <title level="m">Shelleyesque</title> subject of Gothicism. Where the
                    Shelleyan gaze finds synthesis, desire, pleasure, beauty, benevolence, and
                    being; the Shelleyesque gaze finds antagonism, drive, <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, monstrosity, perversion, and lack. We resist the
                    temptation to literalize this split or to apply a rigid definition to either his
                    Gothic or Romantic works, terms that should be used provisionally. As Michael
                    Gamer reminds us in his <title level="m">Romanticism and the Gothic, </title>“at
                    the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century . . . neither
                    ‘gothic’ nor ‘romantic’ had yet taken their modern meanings” and that the Gothic
                    is rather “a discursive site crossing the genres” (2-3). As the essays in this
                    volume demonstrate, the tension between <emph>Shelleyesque</emph>-Gothic and <emph>Shelleyean</emph>-Romantic
                    aesthetic modes operate dialectically, if not antagonistically, across the
                    entirety of Shelley’s writing. </p>
                <p> Rather than an undisciplined juvenile phase of Shelley’s development (as many
                    critics have argued), the <emph>Shelleyesque</emph> haunts the
                        <emph>Shelleyan</emph> in unsettling and provocative ways. The
                    Gothic, for Shelley, thus provides an aesthetic foil against which his most
                    idealistic moments are generated. Shelley’s Gothic provides a baseline account,
                    so to speak, of his earliest attempts to articulate a mode of subjectivity that
                    recognizes rather than sublimates the political, sexual, psychological, and
                    aesthetic antagonisms produced within the social field where the combinatory
                    dynamics between subject, self, object, and other are expressed. Shelley’s
                    Gothic indexes a site of failure when imagination stutters or when the
                    aspirations of the Romantic ego are confronted with the void of subjective
                    destitution. But the Gothic also opens up the possibility of symbolic
                    transgression and transfiguration, exploiting the aesthetic machinery of the
                    Gothic tradition while radically undercutting the expectations associated with
                    that tradition. </p>
                <p> Jerrold Hogle’s essay outlines the contours of what he calls the “Gothic
                    Complex” in Shelley’s works. This complex of “interacting symbolic processes,”
                    which Hogle argues can be found from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s
                    Walpolean borrowings all the way through to <title level="m">The Triumph
                        Life</title>, serve as a “repository for unresolved conflicts among
                    contending beliefs.” Focusing on the “Shape all light” from the <title level="m"
                        >Triumph</title>, Hogle shows how this Janus-faced figure exemplifies
                    Shelley’s preoccupation with Gothic imagery that is “continuously being
                    un-shaped and re-shaped again” as Shelley himself shapes and is re-shaped by the
                    symbolic processes he employs. Ultimately, for Hogle, Shelley, the poem, and its
                    audience “cannot escape from the systems of belief” Shelley wishes to dismantle. </p>
                <p> Tilottama Rajan takes up Professor Hogle’s “Gothic Complex” and refigures it as
                    a “Gothic Matrix.” Rajan asks whether the Gothic complex “serves as a transition
                    out of a particular historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent
                    kernel of error at the heart of all idealism.” Rajan argues that the “flattened
                    out” Gothic complex that Shelley inherited becomes a matrix “interimbricated
                    with Romanticism itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses texts that
                    do <emph>not</emph> formally belong to the genre.” Rajan analyzes the fluidity
                    and creative potential of this matrix by drawing on Hegel’s distinction between
                    the “symbolic” and “romantic.” For Hegel, the symbolic mode registers the
                    insufficiency of the idea to its content, whereas the romantic mode registers
                    the insufficiency of the content to its idea. The Gothic, as the symbolic
                    disfigurement of the Romantic idea, is thus a “shelter for the potentiality of
                    superstition and perversion,” which Rajan sees exemplified in the dual figure of
                    Ginotti/Nempere in Shelley’s second Gothic novel, <title level="m">St. Irvyne;
                        or, The Rosicrucian</title>. </p>
                <p> Robert Miles’s essay on <title level="m">The Cenci</title> reflects upon the
                    theoretical approaches of Hogle and Rajan and notes that “Gothic and Romantic
                    are indispensible terms for delineating a whole that is larger than either.”
                    Miles argues that the Gothic complex, or “symbolic constitution,” produces an
                    intractable deadlock in <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as: “the dead hand of
                    the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions that live on in the
                    present; the very notion of a vicious circle; a moral antinomy that prods the
                    reader into analytical action; conspiracy; a belief in the totalizing power of
                    tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining historical agency; the delusive
                    glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and certainly not least, critique of
                    Burke.” Miles reads Shelley’s Introduction to the drama against itself, pointing
                    out that “to explore one’s own dark heart,” as Shelley instructs, “one would in
                    casuistical fashion need to name and identify all possible motivations for a
                    particular desire. The act of bringing them to light is also the act of bringing
                    them to horrific life.” For Miles, the difficult ethical demands of <title
                        level="m">The Cenci</title> reveal a Shelley who is “uncompromising about
                    our inability to emancipate ourselves into free agency while drawing upon inner
                    resources.”</p>
                <p> From Christopher Bundock’s historiographic perspective, “the Gothic offers
                    Romantic and modern culture a space in which to explore but also contain—through
                    predictable, formulaic gambits—the institutional dismemberment and
                    re-articulation often glossed as secularization.” Through a wide-ranging
                    analysis that focuses on <title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> and <title
                        level="m">Adonais</title>, Bundock explores the tensions between the <title
                        level="m">Shelleyesque</title> and the <title level="m">Shelleyean</title>
                    in relation to the persistence of the “matter” of history and of the act of
                    historicization itself. For Bundock, “unnatural, physical reanimation offers
                    form to historical counter-narratives, a way for what is excluded from official
                    accounts to confront history’s aesthetic ideology.” The figure of the Wandering
                    Jew, excluded from Christian history, “collapses progressive history by bearing
                    trauma materially out of the past and into the future.” Similarly, in <title
                        level="m">Adonais</title> Shelley places Keats—his death and body—in a
                    “material vision of history” that exceeds transcendence and eludes mediation,
                    where “elegiac mourning is recast and re-understood as melancholy monstrosity.” </p>
                <p> My own essay on <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> resonates with Hogle’s and
                    Rajan’s theorization of the regressive and progressive tendencies of Gothic
                    iconography for Shelley. My reading of Shelley’s first significant publication
                    places the work in the literary-historical context of the anti-Jacobin backlash
                    against the scandalous transgressions of the Gothic and the threatening
                    progressivism of republican philosophical positions. Shelley enters the fray
                    late in the game and positions <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not as an
                    exercise of generic mimicry, but as an ambitious satire of the “Jacobin
                    monster.” In the character of Zastrozzi, Shelley condenses anti-Jacobin fears
                    and shows how such figures exert their control over the reactionary mind,
                    generating a plague of fantasies for the ostensible “hero” of the novel,
                    Verezzi. At the same time, Shelley also “subjectivizes” the paranoiac image of
                    the other and reveals the impotence of the individual behind the sublime mask.
                    Thus Shelley’s early use of the Gothic is a critical, though perhaps blunt,
                    instrument in the demystification of ideology. But <title level="m"
                        >Zastrozzi</title> also introduces obstacles that haunt any totalizing
                    concept of the Enlightenment subject and/or Romantic ego. Zastrozzi, whether as
                    sublime figure of the anti-Jacobin paranoiac imaginary or impotent subject, is
                    still an implacable other bent on revenge, resistant to the ethics of
                    sympathetic identification, guilt, or shame. </p>
                <p> In later works such as <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, <title
                        level="m">The Cenci</title>, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>,
                    and <title level="m">Hellas</title>, Shelley confronts similar tyrannical
                    figures that echo back to Zastrozzi and the Gothic antagonism he presents to
                    emergent Romantic consciousness. Whether or not Shelley is successful in
                    mediating or transcending those antagonisms depends in large part on whether we,
                    as readers and critics of Shelley, consider his Gothic aesthetic to be limiting
                    or delimiting. It is our hope in this volume to spur further critical
                    investigations into the vexed relationship between Romanticism and the Gothic,
                    being fully aware that, as Shelley put it in <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>,
                    “much yet remains unscanned.” </p>
